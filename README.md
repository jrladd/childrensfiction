## Experiment with corpus of 1880s children's fiction

This is a quick experiment in poetry generation with one of the test corpora available in [Alan Liu's DH Toychest](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244469/Data%20Collections%20and%20Datasets). It was created for a meeting of the Digital Approaches Reading Group at WashU on 19 April 2016.

I make use of a few NLP-related Python tools including [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/index.html) and Allison Parrish's [pronouncing](https://pronouncing.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).
