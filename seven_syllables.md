"None of us boys ever did."  
Carol's joy knew no bounds.  
"And is the next boy Oshkosh?"  
"Why, I have what I call a 'window-school.'  
Mrs. Ruggles looked severe.  
All the little Ruggleses shouted, "Yes, marm!"  
"Yes, marm," they piped, more discreetly.  
This was too much for the boys.  
Mr. Clement, do you eat cramb'ry sarse?"  
"Me too," chimed in Cornelius.  
"But where is Baby Larry?"  
Good gracious, where was Larry?  
Spend all the money you like."  
Perhaps this has done me good."  
and won't you turn my bed, please?  
Such a happy, happy day!"  
It is almost ten o'clock."  
Carol had fallen asleep!

It won't wash, I can tell you.  
"Why, are you going to play?"  
Have a shot at the goal, then."  
said the irreverent youth.  
"Would you like another shot?"  
He was flushed and excited.  
Jeffreys turned on him darkly.  
It was a welcome summons.  
"Thanks awfully, Cad, old man!"  
doesn't he look pleased with himself!"  
"Pick it up and run--like mad!"  
But Jeffreys was past stopping.  
cried Scarfe as he gave the first thrust.  
"I did not mean--" he began.  
"Slowly, and do not keep step.  
"Certainly, sir," said both boys.  
Yet how he dreaded that scene to-morrow!  
Some one was moving inside.  
"Good exercise," said Mr Halgrove.  
"I left Bolsover at half-past four this morning."  
"No, sir; I've run away from Bolsover."  
"I didn't mean to startle him.  
And may _I_ ask where you live?"  
It's there on the table."  
"Pleasant letter, is it not?"  
"I can't go back to Bolsover," said he.  
"You mean to turn me adrift?"  
"Can't you put it off till to-morrow, sir?"  
It's master's orders."  
Is it a long journey, sir?"  
"What do you know about books?"  
Did they ill-treat you, then, or starve you?  
"I shall fight him if he tries."  
I'm older than you, though."  
"Are you going to school now?"  
"Because you were so ugly!"  
What's the name of the house?"  
"Oh, Galloway House, in Ebor Road.  
There was nothing for him there.  
asked Jeffreys, raising his hat.  
"I am the lady," said she.  
"Are you a steady young man?  
"What wages do you expect?"  
"Are you good-tempered and kind to children?"  
Come this way to the schoolroom."  
"How many boys are there here?"  
"I don't know; I haven't tried yet."  
"Well, just mind what you're about.  
There's one o'clock striking.  
Now you'd better get to work.  
"Will some one lend me a book?"  
said one boy triumphantly.  
On the whole he was cheerful.  
"I think he will; he means well.  
And what news would it bring him?  
I wish I could tell you more.  
Oddly enough, it was not.  
"I never dreamt," he faltered.  
"Quite a little sum, isn't it?  
"I haven't got any money.  
Good-bye, my dear boy, good-bye.  
What a time he was having!  
How long ago it seemed now!  
"It's a bad job," said he.  
asked the boy naturally.  
"Yes," said Jeffreys, "pretty well."  
You don't know Jonah, young man.  
said Mr Halgrove; "eh, my little highwayman?"  
"What did you say his name was?"  
He's an--"  Jonah pulled up.  
"Oh, please, sir, please call him off.  
and you are his employer?  
"I dislike him; so does ma.  
School closed, and still his dates were unlearnt.  
he shouted furiously.  
"How long had you been up there?"  
"Are you coming with me Jeff?"  
said the bewildered parent.  
Jonah looked terribly shocked.  
It was a thunderclap with a vengeance!  
"Let's have a look at thee.  
But the sturdy Yorkshire-man stepped between.  
The voice of Mr Rosher roused him.  
"Coom, now, dost thou say liar still?"  
"Hold thy tongue, little donkey!"  
He moved slowly to the door.  
Jeffreys shook his head sadly.  
"You're going," said she, "of course.  
"But, Jeff, where are you going?  
You've done with Galloway House."  
"Why, sir--" expostulated the wretched Jonah.  
And the hint was quite enough.  
But Jeffreys claimed no pity.  
"She died in Torquay five months ago.  
She was a great sufferer."  
inquired the clergyman.  
tell me, for mercy's sake!"  
My guardian has left York.  
for we can go anywhere.  
"Walker has gone to tell him."  
And he politely retires.  
"My dear boy, where have you been?"  
"I'm sure it would answer.  
"It licks the paint into fits!"  
"That's what `millionaire' means."  
Why, it's only half-past seven."  
You know I do not grudge it.  
What does he want with ash sticks?  
"There's a pile of swag there--heaps."  
"A boy--fourteen--only child."  
Get a trifle for him eh?"  
"Do you want your tongue cut out?"  
"See anything of the cart?"  
Percy groped his way to him.  
Come on--watch them there, Julius.  
Watch them, good dog, and stay here."  
said the half- awake Percy.  
The business was soon explained.  
"You are not going, surely!"  
Besides, Julius--"  Mr Rimbolt laughed good-humouredly.  
Every day it grows worse.  
"Was your father a soldier?"  
"It's terrible, isn't it?  
It was useless to hold out.  
cried Percy; "she said she'd come."  
"I was never on such ice!"  
The remainder was easy.  
Julius, hold me, and drag too."  
what a fine little colour-sergeant she'd make!  
He is a perfect darling!  
How's your girl flourishing?"  
If so, it's a relief."  
"She shall have it," said his friend.  
Of course you know about it.  
So he stood for a moment.  
"How jolly proud you must feel!"  
I know that," replied the boy.  
"I beg leave to second that."  
How could it be otherwise?"  
"I have not forgotten it."  
"Is that all you want to say?"  
"I deserved no sympathy."  
Raby smiled one of her pleasantest smiles.  
You will excuse me, won't you?"  
Shall we talk of something else?"  
"`Captain Forrester of the--Hussars.'  
said the boy, "do you mean it?  
"We shall get a splendid view.  
The dog was strangely awkward to-day.  
"Do you mind my going first?"  
"Try to sit up, old fellow.  
SCARFE PROMISES TO REMEMBER.  
"We won't give it up yet, though."  
Jeffreys stood still to listen.  
"How is Percy this morning?"  
Jeffreys bowed and retreated.  
Jeffreys could not help smiling.  
"What is the meaning of this?"  
"It would not interest you.  
"Yes, he is a brave boy, too.  
"Whom are you telling to hush?  
"Let me come in, do you hear?"  
"Who is poor young Forrester?"  
Scarfe could see he had gone too far.  
Had he a wife and children?  
Quite as dead as you are, Jeff."  
Why don't you tell him, Raby?"  
They spent their time not wholly unprofitably.  
"I down on Mr Jeffreys?  
Perhaps he knows you are here?"  
"You bet he'll try to hook her.  
"Don't speak to me of Mr Scarfe.  
"Bring your handsome friend with you.  
"I've not seen Jeff for a week."  
You have no right to say it.  
Ah, I see you know, Raby."  
He seized it again rudely.  
"You mean you don't care for me?"  
"Why did you leave your last place?"  
His story was a sad one.  
Don't be squeamish, old fellow.  
You're not too good, surely--eh?  
How long was it to go on?  
Where, he wonders, is _she_ now?  
Then a voice groaned, "Oh my God!"  
and the footsteps hurried on.  
That was the day of my laugh.  
He left a message for you.  
She's a lady, they say.  
He could not assist the search.  
We saw the Prince of Wales and W.G.  
and he ran whistling upstairs.  
exclaimed the boy, half frantic.  
Tell Appleby, do you hear?  
I'm going to find him!"  
"I don't know--he might turn up.  
I might find him after all.  
You can Yes or No, can't you?"  
"Come, don't be a muff, Percy!  
"What was the name of the school?"  
"_Fama volat_, and so does money.  
So I hope you won't ask me."  
"No, I must be home, thank you.  
"You are harsh with me," said he reproachfully.  
You should not have provoked me.  
The letter's from Jeffreys.  
Does he give an address, then?"  
This was all there was to say.  
You have come through much since then?"  
"No, I have never seen him."  
"Of course; I can't prevent that."  
He became an expert nurse.  
How could he desert them now?  
"Then you didn't see the lady?"  
It was a fire somewhere.  
He looked down from his window.  
It was a shilling well spent.  
The colonel laughed pleasantly.  
They did nothing exciting.  
That's Wild Pike, I suppose?"  
"I knew him a mile away."  
_How_ brickish of you to come back, Jeff!"  
You would hardly know the place."  
"How wonderful it all was!"  
Again they walked in silence.  
I don't like this avenue."

what's the mather with ye spalpeens?"  
he angrily demanded.  
What's the matter with Tim?"  
"What are you thinking about?"  
"Tim, how close are we to land?"  
"I believe they have _gold_ there?"  
It can't be far from midnight."  
"Wait and trust to Providence."  
impatiently exclaimed Tim.  
here comes a man this minute!"  
we never thought about him.  
I am glad he is with us."  
"That is the best plan," said Tim.  
keep still, it is too dreadful!"  
Let's keep a sharp lookout."  
"They seem to be standing still."  
Saved from fire and water!"  
"Now, what is to be done next?"  
"Well, his berth was next to mine.  
"I ain't sure but what they did.  
"There's no mistake this time!"  
We must be very careful.  
"Has he anything to eat?"  
"Ask him for something to eat!"  
He hasn't anything to give."  
Will aither of yez indulge in a few whiffs?"  
"What have you to buy it with?"  
it's meself that came nigh doin' the same.  
That's a fine powdther-horn that he has.  
"I think so," added Elwood.  
he asked, turning to the boys.  
"Nor can I," added Howard.  
"It'll pay yez to carry it there."  
"We can easily test it.  
"I saw it vibrate----"  "Look out!  
"Get down, Tim, or he'll hit you.  
"He is gone," replied Howard.  
"Do yees understand the maning of that?"  
yonder goes that Indian!"  
It was quite late when they camped.  
there are others beside us!"  
you've got your brother with you!"  
"You must be rich by this time."  
What did you give her for it?"  
"What sort of presents were they?"  
"No, no, no; for both of 'em."  
"Yes; we will gladly do that."  
An idea struck Howard.  
"Don't want either; can't do it."  
"Well, we may as well give up.  
"What is the reason you can't?"  
"And here is a long paddle.  
"There we will rest," said Howard.  
I wonder why he did it?"  
But what will become of him?"  
But let us hope for the best.  
"That is if he gets the chance.  
"Did the Indians see me?"  
Their eyes are fixed upon us."  
"Why do you call him _Shasta_?  
"But tell us all about it."  
"How did you and Shasta meet?"  
"I am sure I cannot tell."  
"You are right," replied Howard.  
"Look at that machinery!"  
"And a good one as a friend."  
He doesn't even stop smoking!"  
Ye saam to be losing your sinses intirely."  
"In what part of your body?"  
"I think they will go away."  
"We can't afford to lose him.  
called out Elwood to Howard.  
exclaimed Elwood in delight.  
"This means danger," said Elwood.  
"Shall I give yez some good advice?"  
"Let's take a look at them."  
"I am sure of the right way."  
asked Howard, still more alarmed.  
"We never have been near these."  
"_  [Illustration: "We are lost."]  
"What difference will it make?"  
"We shall have to guess at it.  
he exclaimed, with sparkling eyes.  
"Can it be that Elwood is jesting?"  
fairly shrieked the Irishman.  
"What did you separate for?"  
"We have gone on the wrong track."  
"Arrah now, an' wasn't that done nicely?"  
"Are you going to dress it?"  
He listened, but all was still.  
The boy understood it all.  
"Yes, I am sad enough, too."  
Could yees be afther accounting for it?"  
Let me faal the baal of yer hand."  
"It is for Mr. Shasta.  
The cheering signs continued.  
laughed the boy, "you mean _quintal_."  
"They are white men," said Howard.  
"And is that man Timothy O'Rooney?"

Still my uncle cried "Forward!"  
"Here's something worth having!"  
I threw it down in disgust.  
They were coming towards us.  
They went on as usual.  
Here he lies, and there's the springbok."  
there's water, sure enough.  
I will look out for myself."  
he answered, "we are all right.  
Jan raised a shout of triumph.  
"What poor brute have you got there?"  
"Are there no crocodiles there?"  
He next reloaded his own.  
There could be no doubt of it.  
This was not to be thought of.  
We then started off for the _vlei_.  
We retreated behind it.  
"We shall catch him before long!"

"There's some one in distress!"  
observed our guide, Toby.  
We were at school together.  
"What's all that noise about?"  
"The fact is I did note him.  
He came forward to meet us.  
The next moment I was safe.  
I had heard him fire twice.  
This was more than we could stand.  
"To the station," answered Guy.  
"No fear of that," he answered.  
"We must put an end to these dingoes!"  
At last a sound struck my ear.  
I wish that we could find them.  
"What can have become of him?"  
Old Bob shook his fist at them.  
I asked as we rode along.  
"What had we better do then?"  
"What's the matter, my man?"  
It is well-nigh more than I can bear."  
"He is shot through the body.

"Do you know who it was, Kate?"  
You are a wicked, bad boy.  
What am I to do with him?"  
the squire exclaimed, suddenly.  
"That makes all the difference."  
They are just larks, nothing worse."  
"You don't do really bad things?"  
"Good morning, Reuben," she said.  
"I will speak to him myself.  
"Put it under the pump, lad.  
Reuben looked at the paper.  
"Yes, sir; I believe she does."  
No, Reuben, my plan's best.  
His leg is no worse, I hope.  
or even a stronger oath."  
"I shall miss you dreadfully.  
I was not a bit hasty.  
Now tell me, what are your plans?"  
"Nothing is settled yet, sir.  
I am glad I have met you.  
I know you wouldn't have done it.  
"Not every one, Reuben.  
"Who were you speaking to, Kate?"  
I shall miss them very much.  
"You know the house well, don't you?"  
"Ay, half a mile or so on."  
Mrs. Whitney soon came up.  
"You mustn't be too sure of that.  
"All right, miss," the smith replied.  
"From whom did you hear of it?"  
"You must be unanimous."  
"It is your verdict, not mine."  
I want her to go with me.  
That's how I looks at it.  
'Folks seem to think as he did it.'  
"What tonnage is the vessel?"  
"Can't I go up aloft now?"  
You don't feel giddy, do you?"  
"What are we doing here, Bill?"  
Don't you see that for yourself?"  
"Oh, I never thought of that!"  
"I am sure he looks honest.  
The lad is nearly fainting.  
"So can I," the girl agreed.  
"Did you see him this morning?"  
"It is a serious thing.  
"How are you today, Reuben?  
No, you must come aft with me.  
"And is your mother alive?"  
I didn't expect that from you."  
The captain now left the helm.  
No one hurt below, I hope."  
You had best turn in at once.  
The captain made his way aft.  
Reuben went aft to the well.  
"Is there much of it, captain?"  
"Why not do so now, captain?"  
Think it over for a week.  
I found him out on the plains.  
"I no leave Massa Hudson."  
"I do call it too bad, George."  
That boy Jim is a treasure.  
It's enough to dishearten a man."  
"I suppose it couldn't be done.  
Reuben soon reined his horse in.  
It's nasty work, you see."  
There are at least twenty heads."  
"Yes," he said, "they are warm still.  
They must have camped here last night.  
Lead party wrong if dey can.  
"What do you think, Mr. Blount?  
Reuben turned in the saddle.  
'There's the smoke right behind us.  
Have you had any losses?"  
What do you think of the plan?"  
It is just 'Stand and deliver.'  
They don't mind the risk of that.  
"Not I," the settler laughed.  
"I tink dey not berry far off, sah.  
"De ground more up and down here.  
Reuben asked, in a low voice.  
"I don't smell anything, Jim."  
"What is it, Captain Whitney?"  
I must take your word for it."  
"How many are there of them?"  
Dey not move till light, sartain."  
"I have that rifle and double-barrel gun.  
"Now, I will go upstairs and reconnoitre.  
"They have got the police here!"  
"Haven't you got any loopholes, Caister?"  
"They have been cutting brush wood!"  
So saying, he gave a loud cooey.  
Suddenly a loud cooey was heard.  
"Why, it's the Watsons and my men!"  
"Rode master's horse," Jim said.  
Why, how did you get him out?"  
"How did you come upon them, Shillito?"  
I will ride Caister's spare horse, now."  
At their call, the man came out.  
Dat good guide to begin with.  
Black fellow all one to him.  
"I said I had heard your name.  
"The scoundrels are at their work."  
If not, follow us at once.  
With a shout, Reuben rode down.  
Reuben said, stepping forward.  
"Thank you, Jones, you did quite right.  
No, they have done us, this time."  
"Who is the nearest, Mr.

"He is awake now, my dear.  
You were right and I was wrong.  
Simpson was on guard that night.  
"What do you know about him?"  
"No," Mrs. Barker agreed.  
Perhaps it is the doctor."  
I should make him a bed here.  
"In the right place, eh, Whitney?"  
"And to think it should be you!"  
It seemed so strange, either way."  
What for dey no say dey come?"

one of the men asked, sternly.  
"Massa Hudson tink me took it.  
"You come along with us then."  
"Anything you may be worth.  
Don't you fret about wages."  
The door and shutters were closed.  
It beats me altogether."  
Plenty bad people; much fight."  
If they can go there, we can."  
"Four, six water holes," Jim said.  
Those blacks can run like the wind.  
We come straight from water hole.  
Black fellow go round long way.  
"I am quite sure of that, sir.  
Reuben stepped into the hut.  
"The man you call Fothergill."  
The settlers agreed, at once.  
He galloped forward to them.  
There's nothing else for it."  
"No tink black fellows near, massa."

"Will it ruin us, mother?"  
"And the Russells," suggested Dora.  
There was a moment's pause.  
But what of the uniform?  
"Infatuated woman!"  
"Rose has something else instead.  
What do you think, Jonathan?  
Would its barking disturb you?"

I hope you will excuse her."  
It was a foolish notion.  
I am happy to hear it.

Miss Vanhansen gave her up in disgust.  
she could not help exclaiming.  
Annie's cry was bitter.  
Annie, you must not say that.  
Nothing would grieve father more.  
said Annie, impatiently.  
Won't you let me see you home?"  
What will Hester Jennings say!  
Were they laughing at her still?  
exclaimed Annie, with a gasp.  
"But what is it all about?"  
"I wonder you can laugh, Rose.  
"And what did you say to that?"  
He took his degree with high honours.  
Then he roused himself further.

"What ridiculous rubbish!"  
Lady Usk is angry and roused.  
I think it ought to be spent.  
That is very sweet of them.  
"She isn't Messalina, at least I think not.  
he asks of Mrs. Wentworth Curzon.  
"What a fortunate woman!  
"Count Lustoff, a colonel of the Guard.  
"Yes: they do draw a line _there_."  
"'Purity, daughter of sweet virtues mild!'"  
One has the life one wishes."  
"I lead my own life," Brandolin remarks.  
"My cob,--a cob I adored.  
"Dolly does," says her husband.  
"Then I needn't say so," replies Usk.  
"Won't you come and speak to her?"  
What a charming place this is!  
"Oh, not necessarily."  
"Why have you never married?"  
His wife is slightly annoyed.  
She does not like this sort of jesting.  
Mr. Wootton smiles on him loftily.  
There is a general laugh.  
He thinks very ill of me."  
"It is absurd and untrue.  
It would be very painful."  
"It is very curious."  
"How one comes across people."  
That is nothing uncommon."  
I met her first at the Duchesse de Luynes'.  
such scandal-mongers," says Lady Usk, angrily.  
"What's the row, my lady?  
Bruce is his secretary.  
"What the deuce will Mrs. Donnington say?"  
Strephon and Chloe never used that."  
"Because he's bored at home!  
The gossipers are right, then.  
"It is a figure of speech.  
"I have no heroism.  
"Resentment means remembrance."  
Then she in turn feels angry.  
he asks, without preamble.  
asks the lady of Surrenden, sharply.  
"Madame Sabaroff and Gervase," he growls.  
"And in the human heart," says Brandolin.  
The next morning is Sunday.  
"It is painful to die by driblets.  
"Was she ever talked about?"  
"What charming woman is not?"  
"That she should console herself."  
Brandolin stands near, silent and absorbed.  
says Dulcia Waverley, scandalized.  
Can any one recall it?  
"Where were you all this morning?"  
Poets are dangerous themes.  
"But you see she does not sigh!"  
"All of them, pretty nearly.  
"Do you think she'll marry Lord Brandolin?"  
It is much better," she adds.  
"But you will let me, won't you?  
"I have perfect faith in you.  
"I want to know but one thing."  
She smiles a little sadly.  
"Then----" he begins breathlessly.  
I cannot play the part of eavesdropper."  
Never; that I swear to you."  
"You are unkind," he answers.  
Gervase does not dare reply.  
Brandolin meets her with his hands outstretched.  
"Oh, yes: so are we, aren't we?"  
said the miller's young wife.  
After all, he has his rights.  
He has his employment here.  
Why did he take me away?"  
She took all her woes to him.  
He colored; he knew not why.  
I am your humble servant."  
Gesualdo looked at him curiously.  
Has Tassilo sent you to me, or she?"  
Forgive me if I am rude.  
"Poor innocent, he meant well!"  
And yet of what use was it?  
It was late when he left the mill-house.  
But no one of them would stir.  
Gesualdo made a sign of refusal.  
She had sprung from off her bed.  
He had many enemies.  
"You know I am innocent!"  
The people of Marca were content.  
asked Gesualdo, whilst his own heart stood still.  
That must have been it, I think.  
"But you cannot tell of me.  
Gesualdo made a gesture of assent.  
he said, with passionate scorn.  
Well, hear me, and understand.  
We are to be there a month.  
They have been married three days!  
Well, we must hope for the best!  
No doubt it is only that.  
What a strange institution.  
I could stay on forever.  
I have sent for the steward.  
I have read all my novels.  
You think that very wholesome.  
I only drop adroit hints.  
I dislike that sort of thing.  
If it can't, why doesn't one die?  
It still rains,--rains dreadfully.  
We have been here just three weeks.  
Try and be like her, my dear.  
May heaven save you from both!  
Do you know what they could do?  
Perhaps they would shut up me.  
I have not said anything.

"Going down to Newport, Miss?"  
"Yes, sir," she answered, shyly.  
"Your folks there for the summer?"  
She's down early this year.  
"Been up to New York, Miss Joy?"  
How extraordinary!  
Steady there--what're you about?"  
"I shall see it all summer."  
"What am I to do with her?"  
I'm afraid it means rain to-morrow.  
said Candace; "what a pity!"  
"A pity about the rain?"  
sang out three youthful voices.  
"It's your cousin Candace.  
Come up and be introduced."  
"Is there no picture of her?"  
It was Mrs. Gray herself.  
"But do they mean anything?  
Are they of any real use?"  
And it isn't always lemon.  
"Yes," said Cannie, with a little laugh.  
The day was brilliantly fair.  
She will be glad to be helped.  
They are all watered for to-day, though.  
The girl in the glass smiled back.  
"Oh, I should like to so much."  
"Oh, how perfectly splendid!"  
The sea would be just the same."  
Didn't you ever have a cake?"  
"Cake--on my birthday, you mean?  
Breakfast meantime was at a stand-still.  
"Not I, mamma," said Georgie.  
It's in a chapter called 'Correspondence.'"  
"Please excuse me, Cousin Kate.  
Aunt Myra says it's my safety-valve."  
"I don't care much for sailing.  
"And it seems so far away.  
Candace listened eagerly.  
"Oh, what a wonderful place!"  
"Is that the name of the rock?"  
I think sailing is lovely."  
Gertrude was playing her best.  
Candace looked much mortified.  
"I can't make myself not shy."  
He doesn't mind anybody.  
"Oh, Mrs. Gray, are you there?"  
It's just like Mrs. Gray.  
Mrs. Gray looked at her watch.  
she said, drawing a long breath.  
Such a choice little valley!  
Hold up your hands if you do."  
Do put your things on, and come.  
Do you recollect her name?"  
"I believe so; why shouldn't she?  
I'm awfully sorry.  
rejoined Mrs. Joy, frankly.  
"I use it to keep corks in."  
"No, ma'am, I'm not joking.  
Miss Colishaw was now pale with anger.  
"And who told you I was poor?"  
"Did I ever come a-begging to you?  
"What a horrid old person!"  
It is such perfect folly.  
"You might have kept your temper.  
"Was there a secret staircase?"  
What sort of noise did they make?  
"Yes, ma'am, I believe it was."  
We ran down for a moment."  
"Did you drop something, Berry?"  
oh, Berry, what shall we do?"  
The two rushed across the hall.  
Oh, what will become of me?"  
"Yes," said Candace, "I promise."  
It was an advertisement.  
"How could he treat you badly?  
How did he come to know you?  
"You have promised not to tell!"  
"You promised me solemnly!  
You'll not forget that, will you, Cannie?  
You'll not tell mother yourself?"  
as the clock began to strike.  
She will be sure to notice."  
She will know just what to do.  
"Papa has been, oh, so kind!  
How could I help liking it?  
"Don't look so bewildered, dear.  
Oh, how perfectly--daisy!"  
"Yes, I was; very nasty.  
You are the best girl I know.

"Didn't that man fire at you?  
"Well, not just at that minute.  
"Oh, that's an easy one!"  
"Not a word or a hint, sir.  
"What is the business, Dory?"  
Stirring himself had waked him up.  
The name of the boat was the Goldwing.  
"Please to give me a receipt."  
"Where did you get that letter?"  
Pearl Hawlinshed was not disposed to leave.  
Pearl Hawlinshed had been a wayward boy.  
"Well, what is wanted of me?"  
"Where has your father gone, Pearl?"  
Don't you know where he has gone?"  
"This explains the whole matter.  
"Paid cash for the boat, did he?  
Does he belong in Plattsburgh?"  
That was your father's room.  
"It isn't a bad name either."  
"Haven't I proved that the Goldwing is mine?"  
"She drowned the man that owned her.  
"What was the trouble with her?"  
"Is that what the matter was?"  
"What did she carry it for?"  
To-day it comes down in heavy flaws.  
"How does she work now, Dory?"  
"Does she carry a lee helm?"  
"What in the world does 'luffing up' mean?"  
"Does the boat wear a bonnet?"  
In a boat all sheets are ropes.  
"What do we care for the Missisquoi now?"  
THE BEGINNING OF THE CHASE.  
"What is she chasing us for?"  
This is the jib-sheet, fast to this cleat.  
I shall do the same with the main-sheet."  
The skipper put the helm down.  
The steamer had come about.  
"I have the ropes in my hands."  
"Why didn't we do that before?"  
"We can take it easy now."  
She had got out of that scrape.  
We all thought you had the blues."  
THE STRATEGY OF THE CHASE.  
He had found out his mistake.  
Let her come," replied Dory.  
"Don't worry about it, Thad.  
The steamer seems to stick hard.  
roared Pearl with a string of oaths.  
Dory was silent also.  
"I don't like this thing a bit.  
Thad laughed, and Nat and Dick smiled.  
"The Missisquoi is hard and fast aground.  
Take me on board," shouted Pearl.  
"Are you the boy that bought her?"  
"When are you going, Dory?"  
"I don't know when I shall go.  
continued the detective.  
Was she a dangerous boat?  
"What is all this for, Mr.  
I am afraid to do it.  
"Then why can't you lock us in?  
PEARL HAWLINSHED RESORTS TO VIOLENCE.  
shouted Button angrily.  
"You will catch me first, won't you?"  
said Pearl in threatening tones.  
"Suppose you give it to me?  
He looked at the blinds in the cabin-doors.  
continued the officer.  
"How far off is she, Dory?"  
inquired the officer.  
"I don't agree to the plan.  
"It is wet," answered Dory.  
"What is she doing, Dory Dornwood?"  
"We want to see Theodore Dornwood."  
"No: your mother is not dead.  
"What are you doing up there?"  
"Are you coming down, Dory Dornwood?"  
Are you going back again?"  
"You are a natural fool!  
"I thought you wanted Dory Dornwood.  
THROUGH VARIED STRIFE AND STRUGGLES.  
All I want is my nephew."  
"This is an outrage, Captain Gildrock!"  
"I did not think this of you!  
"That is none of my business.  
I shall search the prisoner.  
And Peppers handed him the bank-notes.  
"I can't leave the boat here, sir.  
She had not given it up.  
"Yes, sir: I had some ham and hard-bread."  
"My mother isn't dead, is she?"  
The landlord hastened to him.  
"Because I never liked him.  
demanded Dick Short, laughing.  
"He treats us fellows like lords."  
You said it was your secret."  
"My sentiments exactly!"  
"Not as I did the last one.  
I have no wife, no children.  
I must pick the boys myself."

'Well, he's safe now, as you see.  
'Oh, how happy mother will be!  
Do you know how late it is?'  
Why, so it is,' cried West Wind.  
Fritz was not wicked at heart.  
"That was bold indeed," I said.  
"What is the matter, my child?"  
Had the wind blown her away?  
"How could I wander so far?  
How could I leave my baby?  
Wicked mother that I am!"  
asked the second, anxiously.  
"No, no," protested Karen.  
Baby _was_ better next day.  
Poor little ignorant girl!

"Yes, indeed, ever so much.  
It was only fourteen miles.  
Matters now looked serious.  
"I'd forgot all about that.  
"Yes, but could you if there were?  
Helen quite jumped at the sound.

She had long been a widow.  
"No, she is asleep," said the padrona.  
You ought to love Fiesole for her sake."

"_All_ the children didn't quarrel.  
"Oh, they are wise little things.  
It was the reply of the May-flowers.  
"We looked everywhere for you."  
"We're going to see Blossom."  
Winnie laughed and shook her head.  
Winnie didn't come yesterday.  
Her face grew a little sad.  
"Happy May-day," responded Blossom.

It was Aunt Polly's voice.  
"You're not in earnest, are you?"  
"But, Aunt Polly, _gingerbread_!  
Such a little thing as that!  
"Aunt Polly, you're a genius!"  
Why shouldn't I make gingerbread?  
Grandmother liked them so much.  
gasped Hexie, clutching at Rafe's arm.  
No wonder they ate so much.  
Her companion was a man.  
That sheep's-head was wondrous savory.  
"Will it do any harm, Rafe?"  
"It may," said Rafe, gloomily.  
"He is somewhat old for that.  
Twenty times they just missed it.  
There was no time to be lost.  
Suddenly there was a shout.  
cried the amazed Winifred.  
It was all long, long ago.  
I am tired of porridge.  
Much you know of noblemen and their ways!  
"You must bind and tie smartly to-day.  
It waved a white arm at me!"  
"Some one laughed," said Pierotte, in an awe-struck tone.  
"Did you want us, good madam?"  
No," replied the "good madam."  
Madam, then, is a fairy!  
"Each of my roses encloses a wish.  
I can't wait any longer."  
And with ripe cherries on it!  
Dear me, how ugly you are!  
What is the matter with us, Pierot?  
So you needn't call me horrid!"  
Oh, how can you say such things?"  
"I don't want to be grown-up.  
I wonder what he'd say now!"  
"Would you like some cherries now, Pierotte?  
I can reach them easily."  
"It's just like her," he said.  
They were out of the wood soon.  
One was pink and one was blue.  
It is sweet to give pleasure."  
What can be better than that?  
"But Lotty sings," said sister.  
"That will be splendid," cried Pet, joyously.  
The work was a birthday frock.  
Something might happen, she thought.  
"Come nearer to the fire.

The parcel was from Lena.  
I do hope you will           like her.  
But there things went wrong again.  
She had put Aunt Emma out.  
Aunt Emma did not love her.  
How pretty and nice they were!  
Oh, dear, how nice it would be!  
I wish you wouldn't use such words.  
"I'm not a little man.  
"Be careful--oh, be careful!"  
"But I didn't see you a bit."  
Lay your finger on me now."  
"Ask mother to tell you one."  
"Very well--so let it be!"  
The charm will end at sunset.  
"Toinette isn't up-stairs," said Marie, from above.  
Marie gave a little scream.  
"We can play all the better."  
asked the good mother, alarmed.  
Gradually the sobs ceased.  
The dame listened with alarm.  
"Saints protect us," she muttered.  
Take my advice, and try it.  
Then, with a nod, he was gone.  
he finished triumphantly.  
"So do I," chimed in Elsie.  
And ever so many books.  
Grandmother lives in Greenock, doesn't she?  
You'll have a splendid time, Jean."  
"Mother, there's a castle!"  
"Ah, but I have," replied Jean.  
I think that blush meant--Sandy.  
WHEN the storks came, the spring came too.  
"They _are_ big," agreed the dove.  
Everything had been sad since.

He thought the master-potter must be glad too.  
Oh, how cruel of father!  
It does make me curious.  
Lies, falsehoods, fabrications!"  
They can never look like us!  
interposed the princess in the pink shoes.  
sighed the little white maid of Nymphenburg.  
"After all, does it matter?"  
"My maker, the Krabbetje,[Footnote: Jan Asselyn.  
He rose slowly to his feet.  
They have sold him already!"  
It was now near ten o'clock.  
"He said eleven o'clock."  
"Are we gone to the Master?"  
"I have come all the way with Hirschvogel!"  
His lips quivered with a broken sob.  
"May I stay with Hirschvogel?--may I stay?"  
"I understand," said the king.  
Will I let you stay with your Hirschvogel?  
"You have got your wish," they said.  
She shivered from head to foot.  
Was this the place of honor?  
Lampblack felt sick and faint with rapture.  
"What am I going to be?"  
His doom, his end, were fixed and changeless.  
His heart was too full to speak.  
"Quite true," said the nightingale.  
"Then the master knew best," thought Lampblack.  
Raffaelle kissed him, and said, "Now listen!"  
said the child a hundred times.  
And she did care for Luca!  
He could have made her happy.  
Oh, angel sent unto men!"  
I have my own idea.  
said Signor Giovanni.  
"It is worth its weight in gold!"  
But not one of the group moved.  
Who was this nameless rival?  
There were but ten of themselves.  
Findelkind timidly held out his hand.  
"Get out of the way with you, Liebchen."  
The keeper of the bridge laughed.  
But do not beg; that is bad."  
A few steps brought him to the Goldenes Dachl.  
Oh, little fool, little fool!  
And it is empty-- empty."  
I dare not tell thy father to-night.

LONDON:  

JAMES NISBET & CO., 21 BERNERS STREET.  
"Mr.  
Moor is _second_ mate.  
I can't begin without her.  
Quite a woman, I declare!"  
That's not hospitable."  
"No, no--about old friends first.  
He goed away nobody know whar'."  
said the captain earnestly.  
"Ain't it a nice place, Nigel?"  
Leastways that's _my_  
experience."  
He  
was bound for Calcutta.  
"A brother of Mr. Ross.  
"Then, may I call you Kathleen?"  
It goes about most  
at night.  
How _do_ you catch the turtle?  
Another nut, please.--Thank  
you."  
Leastwise nothin' in particular.  
I wonder at  
you, father.  
"Are you in earnest, father?"  
"Da's cause I was absint fro' home.  
"From England," replied Nigel.  
THE HERMIT OF RAKATA INTRODUCED.  
Moses shook his woolly head.  
"What a quiet, cosy place!"  
"How much time have you to spare?"  
"Da's right, Massa Nadgel--kite right.  
Come, your breakfast is ready.  
You will be apt to stumble."  
"I will, on one condition."  
and 'sir,' and call me Van der  
Kemp."  
"Do you feel disposed for bed?"  
You won't miss them, I  
daresay?"  
"It is Perboewatan  
that has broken out."  
They shook hands vigorously.  
exclaimed Nigel in surprise.  
"Is that what he is doing?"  
asked Nigel of the negro.  
"Oh no, Massa Nadgel," said Moses.  
"I understand," said Nigel.  
"Now, Moses, are you ready?"  
"Yes, Moses--let's have it."  
"Do it," returned the hermit.  
"Where I puts your bed, massa?"  
asked Nigel in a low tone.  
"Not more nor de man ob de moon.  
"I'll do my best," said Nigel.  
Soon the waves began to rise.  
They hardly knew when day  
broke.  
"Nay, that were impossible.  
"Are you engaged, Van der Kemp?"  
"No--I am at your service."  
He come back bery soon wid all de  
news."  
Moses was a true prophet.  
I am perplexed, however.  
"Shall we manage it, Moses?"  
But you say  
joost now zere is no dancher.  
You have not'ing like zat in England--eh!  
Stay, you vill eat von by ant by.  
Look, zat is a Durian tree before you."  
Men are sometimes killed by zis  
fruit.  
He is alife ant vell, as you shall  
see."  
This was more than it could stand.  
[Illustration: "DO YOU HEAR?"  
But he is sad--very  
sad."  
The professor shook his head.  
"Yes; I came for that purpose."  
"Very," was the curt reply.  
I vill go in zat to Sumatra.  
I vill  
follow ant take my chance.  
Be careful in getting in.  
Now, Moses, are you  
ready?"  
"He's here, massa, all  
right.  
"Are there any in these parts?"  
"You enjoy this sort of thing?"  
asked Nigel, in a low voice.  
"Veil, veil; I've missed him zee tence time.  
I vill  
continue mine business.  
Ve  
must remain two or tree veeks."  
The hermit glanced at Nigel.  
Then he listened intently.  
he said, and listened again.  
"Baderoon is furious at all  
times.  
"Strangely mistaken again!"  
'Off wi' the old love and on wi' the new.'  
He knows vat avaits him if he comes."  
"I did not kill him--thank God!"  
I have been there many years."  
"We're on our way home to Krakatoa."  
"Why, Moses, you're a genius!  
"I'll do it, Moses, at once."  
"I am sure that they would not.  
He would think of something else.  
"I vould as soon shot a  
baby.  
Massa Nadgel, he's twitchin' all ober.  
De tiger's comin' to  
him now."  
asked the hermit in surprise.  
The vixen is not tied up."  
Every man to his taste.  
said the captain  
with a grin.  
"Don't take off your clothes," he said.  
"Isn't you a goin' to take nuffin' wid  
you?  
All the rest I leave behind.  
Moses required no spur.  
exclaimed the clerk in surprise.  
"All except Jim Sloper, sir."  
"Yes--time's about up now.  
said the captain to himself.  
Then aloud, "Well, I'll  
take you."  
"I not frightened," she replied.  
"No, she did not taught me that.  
Do let me stay up," she begged, entreatingly.  
"Canoe just come aboard, sir."  
Crew, three men and a monkey.  
"All right--only stunned, I think.  
what you gwine to do with massa?"  
asked the captain anxiously.  
"Come up now, Winnie, darling."  
"I want you here, Van der Kemp."  
"No man can be sure of that.  
"Strange," said the captain at last.  
But  
it won't be long of----See!  
There it comes," said the hermit.  
"Here, Nigel," gasped the former.  
Mr. Roy, save him!--save him!"  
But them's bigger cracks than or'nar'."  
Moreover, I too am young.  
"No--at least--not with her lips."  
"Come, boy, you're humbuggin' your old father.  
"I don't think of doing so.  
"O that I were a monkey!"  
How long, I am not quite sure.  
Then, at last, Nigel found you.  
"De cave's blowed away too!"  
Winnie had tripped and fallen.  
"What a bootiful bufferfly you is, to be sure!  
You should be ashamed ob yourself!"  
Won't you go in, Miss  
Winnie?"  
Come, let us examine them."  
"Never mind," said Van der Kemp.  
"It does--I don't quite like it."  
"So will I," said the negro.  
"No, Moses, I go alone.  
Boat kin  
look arter itself."  
"De boat-rope," suggested the negro.  
But Van der Kemp shook his head.  
cried Nigel, "I won't fail you."  
"Don' care a buttin for dat, massa.  
He is  
too kindly for that.  
no, not for a hundred t'ousand pounds.

This was the critical point.  
"Rather cold for bathin', ain't it, sir?"  
demanded Miles in surprise.  
"Why, what on earth do you mean?"  
"Now, then, sir, your carridge stops the way.  
"`All is not gold that glitters.'  
"Luggage?--a--no--no luggage!"  
It is a noble service!  
There'll be more  
followin' it before long."  
"Ay, worse luck," returned Sloper.  
Better for me, p'r'aps, if I had.  
Heave ahead or I'll sink you!"  
"Are the beds here pretty good?"  
I'll stand you another glass.  
"But you've been shamming drunk all this time.  
It's on'y the after-cabin you're not free to.  
She don't hamper us wi' no rules.  
Why,  
mate--But what's your name?  
I believe he's kep' it too.  
said the seaman, as Miles rose.  
"It's getting late now, friend.  
"Will you come with me up town?"  
"Come along, I'm ready."  
Is your husband among them?"  
She was young and good-looking.  
He's a corporal now."  
I wish I had known of it.  
"May I follow you, madam?"  
"Why, them are the long-term men."  
And truly their post was no sinecure.  
"Please, ma'am, can I 'ave some coffee?"  
"Yes, indeed," assented her companion.  
D'you think I'll ever believe it?  
Dead and  
buried in the sea?  
She never rose from that bed.  
But where did you run off to?"  
Yes--a small valise--in the carriage.  
Where shall I go to inquire?  
Didn't I tell his father so?  
It was good-natured, lanky, cadaverous Moses Pyne.  
He was too sick to say more.  
it's worse nor bad I am!  
Moses Pyne was  
the other.  
It was raining at the time.  
"Is the soup ready, Moses?"  
"Ay; don't you wish you were me?"  
caused him to look round  
smartly.  
They stand transfixed, sometimes, or stupefied.  
That'll be mair appropriate."  
Why, mate,  
where got ye all that larnin'?"  
He was getting on, you see!  
"No, it is merely a cane."  
His friends had not yet returned.  
Give me your arm, my young friend.  
How you tremble, Marion!  
"Wan wid a rousin' chorus, boy," cried Flynn.  
Simkin contradicted it.  
Sutherland  
repeated it.  
No wonder men won't listen.  
Miles was one of the party.  
asked Stevenson, eagerly.  
"Might be worse," replied his friend.  
It was four o'clock when they  
disembarked.  
but it's thirsty I am!"  
"Have you many mines about?"  
"Yes, we have a good many.  
"So I find," returned his friend.  
You were in luck, being on police-duty."  
I don't think much of my luck.  
He was on sentry duty.  
It was more than he could bear.  
This time the objects were real.  
Among these was Miles  
Milton.  
"Turn the handle, Sutherland."  
I wish  
you had been there, Miles.  
"It's no use  
humbuggin' about it.  
_me_ go to a temperance meetin'?"  
"Don't I wish I was goin' wid them!"  
"No--it's _cat's_ mate--the baste!"  
I wonder you've forgot it.  
Now, I ax  
ye to promise."  
No time for thought after that!  
It was neck or nothing now!  
then, it's dead he must be!"  
"D'ee think we're in for a brush to-night, lad?"  
Miles was a good rifle-shot.  
Here was a complication!  
demanded the Scot fiercely.  
The order, "Stand to your arms!"  
Here, however, they were effectually checked.  
"You shan't die alone, Willie!"  
"You can only die once, Jack!"  
I think it would do me  
good."  
"Quite right, Sutherland--quite right.  
Anyhow it makes mine boil.  
"I know the sort o' thing well."  
It's thrue I had a close  
shave.  
"I never _could_ guess right, Flynn."  
"Well, little Mrs Armstrong."  
"I often think--" said Hardy.  
"But, thank God, many were spared!"  
mother, how can you ask me?  
The look of horror deepened.  
The boiler had been filled with  
salt-water!  
It's all fair and above-board, you see.  
"Are all that come here Blue Lights?"  
_He_ was a Blue Light, wasn't he?"  
LED INTO CAPTIVITY.  
"Because I _never_ say that!  
replied Simkin, with a half-jesting smile.  
"Why, I warn't tired  
a bit.  
"Yes, what do it recall, lad?"  
said Molloy, nodding his head.  
How  
they did stuff, to be sure!  
They had no means of support.  
It's all hypocrisy."  
asked  
Jack Molloy, in surprise.  
echoed the interpreter.  
Tell the baboon to go on.  
cried the delighted Molloy.  
He do dis 'cause he hate you.  
Somehow you has anger  
him.  
I saw you holding the Mahdi's  
horse.  
"You is young," he said, "and knows not'ing.  
Is not this unmanly--childish--humbug?  
There is no principle here.  
"An' you wasn't far wrong, my boy.  
D'ee think I'm any taller?"  
"They've half-hanged me  
three times already.  
"I can tell only of one.  
I wish I could say he's  
well.  
asked Miles, when the door was  
shut.  
but I'm  
right glad to see you.  
What mischief have 'ee bin up to?"  
Must have bin some other way."  
I have no hope at all now."  
I shut  
door and cover up--rubsh.  
Tell what me say,  
and com quick!"  
Molloy came down last," said Miles.  
"Men have to learn to bear and  
forbear."  
After that wait for orders.  
God help us to do it well!  
He raised himself and looked round.  
poor fellow, he won't last long!"  
asked Mrs Drew in surprise.  
Give us your flipper, my boy!"  
But first,  
is there _nothing_ left?  
"I thought you said two, my son."

"That is right," the bailie said.  
It could not be otherwise.  
Andrew exclaimed angrily.  
"But how came ye there, young sir?  
"I shall get him out somehow.  
"I know you cannot, uncle.  
You will hear more yet of M.  
Still the note gave him comfort.  
"That's right," the woman said.  
"Will they hold her, do you think?"  
"Not a chance of it, Ronald.  
The cables ran out to the bitts.  
"It all comes back to me now.  
Right glad am I to see you.  
"Not a word," Sandy replied.  
These men differ like others.  
"That I can tell you at once.  
"I have been in Scotland, sir.  
"Why, you should rejoice, Ronald."  
Now, what will you do, Malcolm?  
A sair day was that for us a'!  
And this is Leslie's boy!  
"What do you mean, Anderson?"  
the colonel asked in surprise.  
"And I too," the major said.  
"I am a stranger in Tours."  
"There is nothing like freedom.  
"Oh, you have been a soldier!  
She was crossed in love, poor girl.  
Let me see, what was her name.  
I have heard Jeanne speak of her.  
Still, you know what husbands are.  
"No, indeed, on my honour!"  
"You look it," the latter said.  
"Well, you must not get ill now, Amelie.  
But that is not possible."  
"How then could it be done, Jeanne?  
"Oh, yes, that is possible!"  
Mind and place them in your bed.  
Well, then, it is all arranged.  
and with a cry of "Mother!"  
"Who is that with you, Ronald?"  
she said, holding out her hand.  
"No, my son," the countess said.  
"How old is my grandfather?"  
Ronald exclaimed bitterly.  
"Why, what do you mean, Malcolm?"  
"Nothing serious, I think.  
"Macleod, will you act for me?"  
"Good heavens, it is Crawford!"  
It is all over with him.  
There was a general laugh.  
"Thank God you are safe, Ronald.  
you have discovered that, eh?"  
Now, only one word, Leslie.  
"I am sure of it, Ronald.  
There are no secrets at court."  
I saw nothing suspicious.  
Do not press your horse too fast.  
"It is a campaign, Ronald.  
"It was not your fault, Malcolm.  
Malcolm exclaimed fervently.  
"It is on your way to Tours."  
"God is indeed good to me.  
Will you hide it in your dress?  
Amboise was reached without adventure.  
There were four parties of them.  
With a bow he now stepped back.  
"You must be calm for his sake."  
I knew you too well for that.  
"Things have not gone well," he said.  
"Yes, there is a small chateau.  
I was there once as a girl.  
I will answer for them all.  
I will have it raised tonight.  
the countess asked anxiously.  
And I want you here with us."  
The duke started as if struck.  
the duke said furiously.  
"Thank God you are safe, Ronald!"  
he exclaimed as they entered.  
I do not remember you."  
I am Colonel Macdonald.  
And now, duke, what is your news?  
When are we going to sail?"  
"He is a noble young prince.  
He is fighting for his own.  
Still, you know, these things may come."  
Malcolm asked, coming forward.  
"Why, it's my boy Malcolm!"  
"How many arms did you get?"  
"That will do well," Lord George said.  
"My father was Leslie of Glenlyon."  
the secretary exclaimed.  
"Of course, I know the name well.  
CHAPTER XVI: The March to Derby.  
I wish you a safe journey.  
Ronald exclaimed in surprise.  
The prince is badly advised.  
"But what is the plot, Andrew?"  
"Thank God that is off my mind!"  
I ought to have foreseen this.  
"That is better, is it not?"  
Where are we to get water?"  
he asked the lad in Gaelic.  
"That is all right," Malcolm said.  
"We shall do here capitally," Malcolm said.  
"Father and son, I suppose.  
"We don't want money," he said.  
"Ah, Malcolm, is that you, man?"  
I fear they will have him yet.  
The priced asked is very low.  
Colonel Leslie was silent.  
I myself have no ties here.  
There is little more to tell.

"Didn't you strike William Poodles?"  
"Don't you call that a fight, sir?"  
My uncle was a strange man.  
"_  Bill begged me to assist him.  
He was insane with passion.  
Bill Poodles is the liar!"  
"Three cheers for Ernest Thornton!"  
"Fellow-students," said I; and the school-room was quiet.  
I bowed, but made no reply.  
Apologize to Poodles!  
I did not understand it.  
"And when did you do those two?"  
repeated the principal.  
The Splash lay broadside to him.  
He was reckless and desperate.  
"Are you satisfied, Thornton?"  
I cannot eat my own words."  
I felt that I had done right.  
"What are you going to do?"  
Have you anything to say?"  
shouted half a dozen boys.  
"I don't want to; but I will.  
We are not little children.  
Mr. Parasyte wiped his brow again.  
"That's all; you may sit down."  
exclaimed Mr. Parasyte, savagely.  
I glanced at the document.  
He looked cool and malignant.  
said he, moving towards me.  
"I can't help it if I have.  
I replied, indignantly.  
"I cannot do it, uncle."  
"He attempted to do so.  
gasped he, pausing before me.  
What do I care what they think?"  
I only asked the question."  
Was she in a proper place?  
"Turned you out of house and home!"  
"We don't know, and we don't care.  
It was cordially approved.  
shouted one of the students.  
How many of us shall go?"  
What are you going to buy?"  
"The boats are secure--are they?"  
"Certainly, if you want to."  
"That will not do," I added.  
"No, that wouldn't do," continued Vallington.  
demanded our leader.  
"What shall we gain by moving?"  
"Can you make her out, Ernest?"  
"What shall we do if it is?"  
"It's me," replied Poodles.  
"I don't know that we want you.  
What had become of the boats?  
demanded the general.  
"That's what's the matter!"  
"Who stood at the south station?"  
continued the general.  
"I know," replied Ben Lyons.  
"That accounts for it," added Vallington.  
"Mat Murray," replied Slivers.  
"It's as clear as mud now.  
"I want this boat," I replied.  
asked he, in a milder tone.  
I called to my companions.  
said the lame man, with a sneer.  
"What is he going to do?"  
"Let go your painter, Dick Pearl!"  
"Sit down and bale out your boat!"  
"Keep cool and you are all right.  
"You meant to drown me--did you?"  
"Don't tell me I was careless!"  
"Let me hear no more of your impudence."  
"Will you get into her, sir?"  
"No, I will not," he replied.  
"You will take me to the shore."  
We were not long left in doubt.  
"Did you make this confession?"  
demanded Mr. Parasyte, sternly.  
he asked, hailing me in the wheel-house.  
"To go ahead," I replied.  
"Now, fellows, what shall we do?  
"Can you steer her, commodore?"  
"What are we going to do?"  
"Not a bit of it, Ernest.  
"I don't know about it, Tom.  
we won't hurt her," replied Tom.  
"What's the use of talking?"  
I was left alone in the wheel-house.  
"What are you about, Thornton?"  
"_I_ don't, but I think _you_ do.  
"O, yes, go ahead," interposed Bob Hale.  
"I didn't pilot her aground.  
the general proceeded.  
"Then you really expect her."  
"What are the fellows to do?"  
"But you are not headed for Parkville."  
"She is almost upon us!"  
"We have been breaking away."  
"Did you consult the agent?"  
"No, sir; he was not at home."  
"No more than myself, father.  
The boys clapped their hands at this interposition.  
"But there may be some mistake."  
"What are these circulars for?"  
With him the case was desperate.  
It was as brief as his speech.

The action takes place about 1835.  
But you should have seen his hands!  
I'll just tell you what he'd do.  
"We've no time for picking sixpenn'orths, boy.  
"Here, let's get some of these."  
Why didn't you bring a basket?  
"There you are," he cried at last.  
"Small profits and quick returns.  
bad thing illness, I suppose.  
Not according to Cocker.  
Glad to see her any time.  
"That's right," he said, laughing.  
It was Brownsmith's baboon shied that.  
"I should like to come," I said dolefully.  
I say, is your ma better?"  
"Ain't going to die, is she?"  
"You haven't brought her yet," he said.  
Come in, or I'll pull you down."  
"Oh my, isn't it jolly cold!"  
"It takes all my breath away."  
Here you, Dennison, come in."  
It's so easy: look here!"  
"Can't," he cried, "tide runs so sharp.  
I say, isn't he a molly."  
"I say, why don't you come in?"  
"Oh, I say, isn't the tide strong!"  
Why, what are you afraid of?  
"Then get used to it," he cried.  
"Let's get out and make him."  
"Why, what are you afraid of?  
There, jump out of your jacket.  
"Would it matter if I did?"  
"Catch hold of my hand," cried Day.  
"You'll take me where it's deep."  
There, go on then by yourself.  
"I say how do you like it?"  
"I should like to swim," I said.  
What do I remember next?  
He's all right, I tell you.  
"You went out too far," Day said.  
"How was it I went too far?"  
But I say, you're better now."  
"No, of course you haven't," he said.  
it's a bad job, my lad!"  
You did--stopped with her a deal."  
"I'm afraid,"--I began.  
"'Member coming for the strawberries?"  
"Yes, sir, I did then," I said.  
"Who, sir--my uncle Frederick?"  
I said, looking up at him wonderingly.  
I said wonderingly; "what, learn to be a market-gardener?"  
Cats don't come into the house."  
You don't know; of course you don't.  
"But not of gentlemen market-gardeners, eh?  
"It is instructive then, sir?"  
"No," he said, "I never did.  
I was content with plodding.  
"But, indeed, sir," I began.  
So now suppose you be off."  
I DECIDE AND GO TO WORK.  
I jumped up excitedly.  
"Do you hear what I say, sir?"  
"Yes, but pray take care, my dear.  
We'll take it up after tea.  
"Give him the slate, Ike," said Old Brownsmith.  
"But shall we fill a barge to-night, sir?"  
"River!--show you what, my boy?"  
"You look very strong," I said, evasively.  
Yes, and so I am, my lad.  
"And what time did you get up?"  
Never send 'em to the wash.  
"Why, he is a clever boy.  
"Yes, you're too heavy behind."  
"Not I," growled another voice.  
"He's out," said Ike gruffly.  
"Go and load up then," said Old Brownsmith.  
"We must risk the damaged goods."  
"That's the way!--capital!  
"Shakespeare, sir," I said, rather drowsily.  
"Where did I hurt you, my boy?"  
"That's it: go it, master!  
Mind you don't miss that handle."  
Accident--Ike didn't mean it."  
Hasn't been rough to you, has he?"  
I shall be there by and by.  
"Only a little stiff, sir."  
"Well, then, we won't waste his time.  
"He is," said Mr Brownsmith shortly.  
"Then you don't want me no more?"  
"Trying to move it, was you?  
"You ain't going to cut then?"  
"I shall tell Mr Brownsmith myself."  
It was only my gammon.  
"That's about safe," he cried.  
"But it wouldn't be true," I said.  
he replied, with a queer look.  
"Want me to move the ladder?  
"There you are, my lad," he said.  
It was like lightning almost.  
"Well done, little one," he cried.  
Here's the ganger coming.  
"Yes, sir," I cried hastily.  
"I'm very sorry, sir.  
"My job," he said quietly.  
You were quite right to tell me."  
he ejaculated, looking at me sharply.  
"Shock, shall I shift yours 'fore I go?  
"It's a hedgehog, isn't it?"  
It seemed very horrible!  
"Do you eat anything else?"  
"Do you eat anything else?"  
"But do you really eat rats?"  
I ketch 'em in the medders."  
AN AWKWARD PREDICAMENT.  
he whispered hoarsely; "arter the pears?  
"Don't care; they've gone after them.  
"Let's rush 'em together."  
I'll never come no more, sir.  
Pray let me go this time, sir."  
It was--oh, please let me go!"  
You know who I am: George Day."  
Rare and frightened they _was_ too.  
Can't you tell the difference?"  
Do you see this old hard bough?"  
Nature is not a bungler.  
I knocked him down angrily.  
"Any one could go by day.  
It's some night's the time.  
"Would you rather have this boy?"  
"Not give him enough to eat!"  
"Not at all," I said, laughing.  
"Yes, I suppose so," I said.  
"And I've got five and two, lad.  
"Didn't they hang the highwaymen in chains, Ike?"  
"Wasn't it very horrible?"  
"No," I said laughing; "never."  
"Give me the whip," I whispered.  
You'll get something you don't like."  
"But it seemed so strange," I said.  
Or, as he gave it to match Do-ho-ver--"O-ho-ver."  
What a scene it seemed to me.  
over and over again.  
We sha'n't want no more for this lot.  
Now don't you two leave the cart.  
But that would not do, I knew.  
There was no doubt about it.  
I cried; "look out for the cart."  
make him pay up," said the first.  
Here, what money have yer got?"  
The two men at the door laughed.  
"Let go, will yer--d'yer hear; let go."  
"Look at that, now," cried the big ruffian.  
I shouted with all my might.  
"I don't know about no ropes."  
"To be sure I am, my lad.  
"But he will," I cried again.  
They're a bad lot down that court.  
"But they wouldn't have hurt me, Ike?"  
Frightened you into it like."  
How did you know where I was?"  
P'r'aps they've got him instead of you."  
"You haven't left the cart alone!  
said Ike as we reached the cart.  
"And he saved the rope," I said.  
"Without old Ike, eh, my lad?"  
I should like to be a man."  
"Yes," I said, "I shall tell him."  
I wish I had some more glass."  
"I wish you had, sir," I said.  
"Won't do--won't do, Grant," he said.  
"Yes," I said, "a gardener."  
he said, laughing silently.  
That's my theory, my boy.  
Nature is kinder than that.  
"But he was a man," I said.  
"`It could not be done,' they said.  
`It would be too horrible.'  
"`I know it,' said the swineherd sadly.  
said the poor fellow calmly.  
About that I know nothing.  
"Yes, this is he, Solomon.  
"Shall I have to go soon, sir?"  
"Will you come with me, Ginger?"  
"Get out, you discontented warmint!"  
"It isn't my fault, Ike," I said.  
"No one, Ike," I said humbly.  
A COLD START IN A NEW LIFE.  
from the women; and then--_whack_!  
"Master's," he said, shortly.  
"Yes," I said; "but what a place!"  
"No it ain't," he said gruffly.  
"Was it like this when you came?"  
I cried with animation.  
"This is the ornamental.  
"I can't tell you how much, sir!"  
cried a sharp unpleasant voice.  
He missed his aim: I missed mine.  
"Oh, what a cracker, Brownie!  
If you do I'll tell papa."  
It was close up to his mouth."  
He won't like it when he hears."  
"Will you go out quietly?"  
There, say no more about it.  
I hope you'll be very clean."  
I did, and looked at it well.  
Never give them any rest."  
"I tied up those two flower-stems," I said.  
will that bear grapes next year, sir?"  
`I know what boys are,' she said.  
he said, looking down at me.  
To be sure," he continued.  
said Philip; "why, I told you.  
"Then what's he doing here?"  
He's just the sort for that."  
They're glad to get rid of 'em."  
said Courtenay haughtily.  
"Why, you've got the pauper there!"  
"You're a liar, you pauper!"  
"How is it you are here, then?"  
"And what have you had to eat?"  
"I was coming to stop it.  
"Go on," he said; "keep it up.  
"No, I'm not; I'm glad.  
I HAVE A DIFFICULT TASK.  
"Seen any more of that boy?"  
"Why, what are you doing here?"  
"No, you ain't," he said gruffly.  
he cried; "don't go on that how."  
But why did you leave Mr Brownsmith?"  
"Did you have a quarrel, Ike?"  
"Indeed but I am," I cried.  
"Yes," said Mr Solomon.  
"Going down," said Courtenay.  
"Ain't you going to try her?"  
"That's a blessing," he said.  
"I've been down worse wells than that."  
said Philip menacingly.  
It is so jolly and cool."  
I don't call that anything."  
"There's foul air lower down.  
"I can't afford it," he said.  
"Tie the rope round me," I said huskily.  
"But I'm not ill," I said.  
Why, you look poorly, my lad.  
Gardeners are never done.  
"Yes," I said, rather faintly.  
"But you don't want no doctor.  
Load or two would do this good.  
"Does Ike know I'm going?"  
he replied with a grim smile.  
And so you are going too?"  
I know what I'm about.  
What is there to see in that?"  
"San'-martins' nesties," said Ike, pointing with his whip.  
"There's clouds of 'em sometimes.  
Only best coarse white, you know.  
"But it isn't half full," I cried.  
I'll find a cave in the sand."  
"And what are we to live on?"  
"What are you going to do?"  
"No: I don't want any, Shock.  
Well, we shall have to get out."  
Scratch yer way, and make a hole.  
I said, "it's horrible."  
"Why, of course he will," said Shock.  
"I say, don't you be frightened.  
You don't mind the dark, do you?"  
I likes dorgs, and we was reg'lar good friends."  
I said; "is that Ike digging?"  
"Let me have a try," I said.  
some as I chucked behind me?"  
"I'm not there, Shock," I said.  
"Like Old Brownsmith's toolips," said Shock, laughing.  
"I'd ha' came shovelling arter him 'fore now.  
I said, "do you hear that noise?"  
I could eat a bit o' you."  
"Don't," I said with a shudder.  
"Sand comes down and smothers yer.  
I says at last, `and they may foller.  
"`Where's young Grant and the boy?'  
"`She's not there now,' he says.  
You wait a couple of days.'  
Bring the reins; they're strong and new.'  
I'm over a big hole.'  
"`It'll cave in,' says one of 'em.  
I shouts, `I shall want two ropes.  
and there came back a `Hooray!'  
"`I shall want my legs,' I says.  
I should think I do hurt you.  
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.  
What I been doing, Mars Grant?"  
Thought I'd been having a nap.  
"Yes, I suppose I did, sir.  
cried Sir Francis, severely.  
"Have you seen his collection, Brownsmith?"  
"Oh what a wicked story!"  
"And didn't you go to join him?"  
"To get a lot of my pears?"  
"I can't tell you, Sir Francis."  
"Why not tell the whole truth, Grant?"  
cried Philip indignantly.  
said Courtenay haughtily.  
"You're a pair o' nice uns--you are!  
But you're ketched this time," he added.  
"How dare you speak to us, sir!"  
"Now you, Grant," said Sir Francis.  
"That will do, my lad," he said.  
The lieutenant's inside."  
He sank back and his jaw dropped.  
he said, seizing my hand, "Oh!  
"What would you have had me, then?

"He isn't, nurse," I cried fiercely.  
"My father isn't mad," I said.  
Tick fass in big hole big tree."  
"He isn't clean; he can't be, dear.  
nurse," he cried; "how well you look!"  
"That's right," said the doctor.  
"You haven't got any," I said.  
Why, nurse, how this fellow grows!"  
"Oh, yes," I said; "and I sha'n't mind.  
I'm sure he is not dead."  
You've grown a great fellow now.  
It will bring you back your health."  
"I know you will, Joe," he said.  
Jimmy juss a fellow to take."  
"Don't do dat," he cried fiercely.  
"Then you have a son, captain?"  
We'll find him and bring him back."  
"Plenty good to eat like much muttons.  
"Only his flurry, my lad.  
"Look at that," cried the captain.  
We nearly had him that time."  
Let's go up more softly.  
It was all plain enough now.  
said the doctor anxiously.  
"That's land, isn't it, captain?"  
Who wants to get ashore, boy?  
"Pull, you cowardly humbug!"  
"Oh, the night before you did."  
"Wanted to," he said coolly.  
"'Cause I wanted," he replied surlily.  
Here, where's that Malay chap?"  
I wish you wouldn't bother so."  
You are a cool one, you are.  
The ship wouldn't move afterwards."  
Here, we don't want you two boys."  
"Now then, you dog; surrender!"  
"Here, now then, all together.  
"There, he's come up again.  
We'll set him ashore first chance."  
"Oh, I'm all right, my lad!"  
"And what did your father say?"  
"Do you mean Joe Carstairs' black fellow?"  
"Jimmy better--much better.  
"Yes, Jimmy knock um head flap."  
"Jimmy not knock um head flap?"  
Brown fellow kill all a man.  
"Big bunyip--no brown fellow--big black bunyip debble, debble!"  
"What did you kick him for, Jack?"  
"I think I shall like Noo Guinea."  
"We must not stir in this case.  
"And how about the doctor?"  
I wish he'd gone ashore too."  
HOW I RAN FROM THE WHITEBIRD CATCHERS.  
"Then you think we are safe now?"  
"Nobbled," said the captain; "and sarve 'em right.  
How am I to punish him?"  
"But hadn't we better get on?"  
"There they are; can't you see 'em?"  
"Say sixty," said the doctor.  
I won't do so any more."  
"Now go and lie down again."  
"It is of no use," I said fretfully.  
Mind and keep up a good blaze."  
"Got hold of me--drag me in."  
cried the doctor suddenly.  
"I'm going to loose him."  
"Now let me look at your foot."  
"It don't hurt," said Jack faintly.  
"I did go on," he replied.  
"Oh, yes; he'll come back," I said.  
Lend me another line, Joe Carstairs.  
"I know I should," I replied.  
That's what I'll do with you."  
"This can't go on much longer.  
Gyp, didn't you hear anything?  
"Here, where's that chap Jimmy?  
Yes," I said impatiently.  
"He's a good dog, you know.  
What is it he's after?"  
You can go if you like, though."  
And I don't try to talk gruff."  
"I don't understand you, Jack."  
"I'll ask him not to," I said.  
"Look there--there's long thin arms!  
I know I hollered something."  
I said, preparing to jump.  
It's lucky they are gone."  
For it really was a feat.  
"Well, then, what shall I give you?"  
"Tickpence," said he, grinning; "give Jimmy tickpence."  
"Nev mind, Jimmy spend tickpence all a same.  
You must want it awfully."  
He saved your life yesterday."  
My indignant young hero!"  
"But was he not very ill?"  
Could a dying man do that?"  
You no fro down wallaby."  
No see poor Jimmy not nev more."  
Tief fellow tole a boomerang."  
"I feel sure I am," I said.  
"No," I said; "very little.  
"No, I'm sure it is not!"  
It's wind amongst the trees."  
"Go in a bush and starve a deff."  
retorted that gentleman.  
I said, wiping my forehead.  
"I don't say I ain't afraid.  
shouted the doctor to me.  
"You bore it very bravely."  
Here, fill my cup with water."  
"Why, Joe, my lad, what is it?"  
I was a little one then."  
"All depends," said Jack coolly.  
"I think I shall keep the score."  
"It is no time for trifling.  
You'll hit some one directly."  
"Why, of course there is," I said.  
"Is there any water there?"  
don't say that," groaned Jack Penny.  
HOW JIMMY TURNED UP A TRUMP.  
Its effects were wonderful.  
said the doctor quietly.  
I'm sure you're not afraid?"  
said Jack, contemptuously.  
"What, about being afraid?"  
"Only let's get on now."  
"Who cares for the savages?"  
yes," I whispered hastily.  
"I only just closed my eyes.  
cried the black furiously.  
"Yes, for our pursuers!  
"Now, back as you load, quickly!"  
"What difference does that make?"  
grumbled Jack Penny in ill-used tones.  
"Yah, ah!--big bunyip water, water!"  
"Are you sure it is rising?"  
said Jack, half vexed at my mirth.  
"No, my lad," he said, "nothing.  
"No water go down," he said.  
cried the black impatiently.  
"Black fellow hab big tink," he replied.  
Mass Joe hab big swim 'long o' Jimmy.  
"I won't eat any more, then.  
"Are you tired of the quest?"  
Nerves want a little tone, eh?  
How do you know he is poor?  
"Then," he said thoughtfully--"then?  
"Let's see," said the doctor.  
Jimmy kill um all along."  
said the doctor anxiously.  
There, lie down, my lad, and rest."  
"Then let's get on again."  
Findum black fellow round a corner."  
Jimmy killum one big small ole man!"  
I said emphatically.  
"Now for getting back to camp.  
Where must our bearers be?"  
"Wallaby ole man, Mass Joe?"  
Jimmy fro um all away!"  
Jimmy fro um all away!"  
"But I say, look here, Jimmy!"  
"Light fire here; go asleep!  
HOW I FOUND THAT I HAD A FELLOW-PRISONER.  
There seemed to be nothing else.  
Jimmy so glad be with you.  
Show Jimmy black debble hurt um head.  
"We must watch for our time."  
"Only Jimmy find Mass Joe.  
Come along a black fellow.  
Jimmy eat a whole lot fust.  
"I'll keep awake till he does."  
The doctor was close by, then.  
"But you are an Englishman!"  
HOW I TALKED WITH MY NEW FRIEND.  
"It cannot be my father."  
"No, I am sure it is not."  
No find wallaby in hole.  
"Taking us to our friends."  
"Be quiet and follow him."  
Hi come along Jimmy now."  
"Here," I said, "this is a friend.  
"Jack, old fellow, I'm glad!"  
I cried, and I grasped his hands.  
"You heard him say that, Jimmy?"  
said the doctor; "follow me."  
"To our hiding-place," said the doctor.  
Then all was silent once more.  
That day we had an alarm.  
The effect was magical.  
said the doctor finally.  
It is not a case of _try_!  
"We must release your father!"  
"Going a find um; all soon nuff!"  
All top here Jimmy go see."  
Put um somewhere; no know tell!"  
"Find somebody's fader!"  
whispered a familiar voice.  
"We are friends," said the doctor.  
"Much lot black fellow that way."  
"Big hut over 'cross," said Jimmy.  
"No hear um come 'long now," he said.  
"All run way much fas," said Jimmy.  
All go long back to big hole.  
Say Mass Joe come back long o' Jimmy-Jimmy."  
"Can you tell where the cave is?"  
"Can't you tell which way to go?"  
But, Jack Penny, we are right.  
He's a good fellow, Jack."  
"I must call to Jack Penny."  
"Jimmy helped me to escape.  
"Bullet--right through the shoulder!"  
said Jack Penny bitterly.  
he said, in a low calm voice.  
"Place too much big hot," he said.  
"Up, Joe, and you can help haul."  
Oh, burn um--burn um--burn um!"  
"All black fellow gone long way.  
he replied seriously.  
I'll creep forward and listen."  
Carstairs is in there, bound hand and foot."  
the doctor said angrily.  
"He will ruin our plans!  
said the doctor quietly.  
they are lighting a fire.  
The others must have come back."  
"The village is on fire!"  
"We must not leave him behind."  
But the dog would not follow.  
"No," I thought, "he may escape.  
"Set um down come look Mass Joe.  
"Time works wonders, Joe," he said.  
"Yes, `much hungry, where my boy?'  
Want eat black boy; eat Jimmy!"

"You'd better get your wind first.  
Thompson came across to him.  
The House had sixty-one to get to win.  
"This will never do," Frank said.  
Two of us will do for that.  
"Ruthven, we must let her run.  
Row hard when I give the word."  
Take the oar again, Ruthven.  
shouted the angry farmer.  
"What can they be shouting at?"  
Frank could now hear what they said.  
It gave a short yelp and paused.  
Where have you been, Miss Bessy?"  
I walked aft to the helmsman.  
Dey talk and mutter among demselves.  
"I staggered on to the floor.  
At last we entered the straits.  
They had all got handspikes in their hands.  
he said, 'you have just come in time.  
"He does not, Jack," Ruthven said.  
Tide was low when they started.  
Then he returned to his friends.  
Everything depends on you.  
"I owe my life to you, Frank.  
"Now, what had we better do?  
The boys watched them breathlessly.  
We'll be with you directly."  
It was as the boatman said.  
Upon seeing Frank he turned.  
"Come in here, my boy," he said.  
The boy's chief fault was pride.  
"How much do you charge a week?"  
A horrible fear seized him.  
Frank said to a policeman.  
"You've done me a heap of good.  
It's no use sitting here.  
We will talk it all over."  
It prevents me from thinking."  
I can't believe they're gone yet."  
Are you out of work yourself?"  
The man looked at him keenly.  
you know it is a macaw!"  
"May I make a group of them?"  
I should have thought them alive.  
You have the knack or the art."  
the old man said in surprise.  
You can cook in the kitchen.  
"My dear old Frank, how are you?"  
"I am so sorry, Ruthven."  
Now, can't you come out with me?"  
I tell you you can't do it.  
"Clothes be bothered," Ruthven said.  
"I've caught him, father, at last.  
My father bought it, not I.  
How can I thank you enough?  
We shall get on capitally together."  
Will you want any knives for skinning?"  
"Two or three little attacks.  
"Look at the boats coming out."  
"What on earth do they all want?"  
he asked Mr. Goodenough.  
Every one was brimful of it.  
"It was not bad; what was it?"  
"Now, Frank, sit up and drink this.  
The draught soon took its effect.  
These were done up in canvas.  
They would soon come to an end."  
Frank asked in astonishment.  
It was a curious sight.  
"We have pitched on the wrong side.  
Two tremendous roars were heard.  
"Yes, we can safely do so.  
The time passed very slowly.  
"Me no like dat nigger," Ostik said.  
The king listened in silence.  
The attack was decisive.  
"Long time me no see white men."  
Me lib in Cuba long time.  
All berry bad business dat.  
Dey flog us if we grumble.  
De heat, sar, was someting terrible.  
De massa he keep his word.  
She turn round and ask, 'What dat for?'  
Seberal men come up and look at her.  
Oder men say something short.  
Slabes all treat bery kind, work not too hard.  
He do bery well here for a time.  
De slabe hab no care and he bery happy.  
But all masters are not good.  
He knock dem ober like nine pin.  
Presently he heard a hail.  
Sam come down to it for sure.'  
"So de matter was arranged.  
Sam almost go out ob his mind.  
He could see no signs whatsomeber ob Sally.  
'Dere is no law against me here.'  
Dose people held deir life in deir hands.  
It war no easy matter.  
"I stopped thar till I was cured.  
"About six miles an hour.  
These were the cannon of the besiegers.  
Frank asked Mr. Goodenough.  
My people will eat them up.  
"We must make the best of it.  
That is the great fetish tree.  
If dey kill massa dey kill Ostik.  
"Is the fort at Cape Coast strong?"  
I am going to do so."  
The army slept on the ground.  
My white friend will go with me."  
"But if there are no cannon?"  
The general looked puzzled.  
"Why do the white men come here?  
"But there are white troops," Frank said.  
To wait means to do nothing.  
"You will see what we shall do."  
Frank felt full of excitement.  
Why did you wish to call out?  
Are you not the king's guest?  
They then returned to the camp.  
They are women and not men."  
"They are called rockets," Frank said.  
We shall do better this time.  
I will manage it somehow."  
Frank was one of the party.  
It was answered by the crew.  
No excuses or pretences availed.  
On the 18th, the Surmatian arrived with the 42d.  
Quarman was stockaded to resist an attack.  
"What can I do for you, sir?"  
How thin you are, and how black!  
Why have you not brought them here?"

A BUFFALO STORY,             173         XI.  
CLEARED AT LAST,             374     ILLUSTRATIONS.  
"What is all that noise about?"  
Evan dashed off at full speed.  
Don't let them wait a moment."  
Don't they fight cool and steady?  
the cripple asked eagerly.  
What does all this mean, Williams?"  
I know who I should shout for."  
Can nothing be done for it?"  
"You stop here, Alice, with Fred.  
"Are you going in, young un?"  
I can do that fast enough.  
That makes the case all the worse.  
"How do you feel now, young un?"  
How on earth did you learn it?"  
"Well, you are a rum fellow!"  
And now I must hurry off.  
Now why should that be, mother?"  
I calls it downright wicked."  
"Why do you wish so, Harris?"  
There was a general laugh.  
'They was Westminster boys,' says he.  
Frank told him what had happened.  
Frank was simply astounded.  
Do you know the handwriting?  
that may afford you some clue."  
Dr. Litter said quietly.  
was shouted in a chorus.  
I wonder what Alice said.  
[Illustration]  CHAPTER VI.  
"Get up, mate, your watch is called."  
he said, as the mate entered.  
"I saw your ship had arrived.  
"Thank you, sir, I will be here.  
Victuals of all sorts is provided.  
"What do you think of it, lad?"  
Feel more comfortable--eh?"  
That's my notion of things."  
Where do you think it could be?"  
"We shall have the sun up soon."  
"About forty yards," Frank said.  
"Yes, that is about it, lad.  
"That's just my idee, young fellow.  
"She's free now," Hiram said.  
Then there is another point.  
"Yes, that is so," Frank replied.  
"I have no doubt of it," Frank assented.  
They war wuss nor the others.  
I knew thar was mischief now.  
"Dick was right, you see," Abe said.  
"Is it always fatal, Abe?"  
"What horrible little beasts!"  
[Illustration]  CHAPTER X.  
"That will last 'em a long time.  
They are after the Cheyennes!  
[Illustration]  CHAPTER XI.  
Dick, take off that thar wig of yourn."  
Do you tell the story, Dick."  
he said, 'they will overtake her.'  
Then the others closed round him.  
don't move, your scout Dick is here.'  
Sudden I says to her, 'Thank God!  
Get on yer horses again.  
They will try other ways fust.  
The tears stood in Frank's eyes.  
Presently the defile divided.  
"We are in a mess," Dick said.  
Now, here is where Frank was wrong.  
"Has he got any money?"  
"Did he confess it to you?"  
"I should think not," Harry laughed.  
"Are you talking of yourself?"  
"Lor' no, sir, the young person."  
"I will lift him up," she said.  
"Open the windows," he said.  
he nodded to Mrs. Holl.  
Drink a little more of this."  
Have you got the seal with you?"  
"It was glorious," she said.  
In vain Harry protested.  
There, grandfather, I have done.  
"Why didn't you go on wages?  
The young man hesitated.  
He could scarcely feel the pulse.  
"What have you been giving him?"  
I think he wants keeping up."  
He joined the others outside.  
"Strength and hope," the young man said.  
you did find a nugget, then?"  
You just do as you are told."  
He whispered, 'How does it look to-day, Jim?'  
They have showed themselves true friends."  
Frank sat for some time silent.  
That is her name and address."  
Will you be my almoner?  
You saved my father's life.  
she asked the waiter in French.  
"An elderly gentleman, Signora."  
"That must be it," Alice laughed.  
"Following me for two months!"  
"I do not understand, sir."  
Frank repeated in surprise.  
"I always said it was Fred.  
Captain Bayley cordially assented.  
"You will all stand up," he said.

THE DAY OF HAPPY LETTERS   III.  
THE LAST OF THE CLOVER-LEAVES      CHAPTER I.  
"But tell me a little more.  
You mean to have a wedding-dress, don't you?"  
"Have you thought what it shall be?"  
Wouldn't it be too enchanting?  
What an immense quantity!"  
ventured Clover, timidly.  
"Oh, I'm not disgusted.  
Don't you want to come and help?"  
The cake-making did really turn out fun.  
THE DAY OF HAPPY LETTERS.  
"May I cut the string, Katy?"  
Or: "'A soft answer turneth away wrath.'  
She whispered     to the others.  
It seems too good to be true.  
"There go two of your hair-pins, Clover.  
I can't think how you do it.  
"I tan walk all by myself.  
cried Katy, catching her up.  
"My Aunt Taty, I dess, betause you is so big.  
cried Rose, catching the child up.  
I think it's delightful!"  
But they _did_ mind very much!  
It doubles the expense, too."  
"That is not so very young."  
"Out West," repeated Katy.  
Well, this is quite a relief.  
This was truly delightful.  
Don't wait dinner for me, chicks.  
"Oh, I haven't any checks yet.  
"Don't call her _my_ old lady!  
It's really too dreadful.  
How can I take care of her?  
Self-preservation is the first law of Nature."  
And so papa telegraphed!  
"Isn't that rather depressing?"  
Clover looked out eagerly.  
It was the best I could do.  
Clover could not help laughing.  
The rooms were on the third floor.  
she called after the doctor.  
Well, we will hope for the best.  
And this is my brother Phil.  
Well, I call this first rate luck.  
I haven't seen them since we left Hillsover.  
The Shoshone, I suppose."  
"How far away is your ranch?"  
And 'us' is me and my partner."  
He's a New York fellow.  
She's not a bit of use."  
Phil was better than his word.  
We are very proud of it.  
said the undaunted doctor.  
A pleasant evening followed.  
I don't know either of them.  
Oh, what's that coming now?  
They never are at the East.  
Isn't it an exquisite place?"  
"I'm sure I don't see how."  
I was so glad to see him."  
was almost his first remark.  
Is that the name of your place?"  
"Well, no; I don't think she is.  
"He'll only be gone one night.  
She rose to examine them.  
"Do you believe he meant it?"  
The air was like scented wine.  
It was a quarter past five.  
He grew cheerful and friendly.  
"Miss Chase will go with the Hopes.  
"What a raving belle you are!"  
"Are you sure your head doesn't ache?  
This air is too delicious.  
Just you and me and Miss Chase.  
She says she'll go if you will.  
Hurry, and don't make a noise.  
Of course Clover wanted to.  
He hasn't osculated me once since I came."  
It was a suggestive one.  
"I'm not absurd at all.  
Who wants to come next to them?  
"I don't care to be loved 'of course.'  
I'm older than you are.  
Clover was fairly crying.  
Did Mr. Beloit send you?"  
"Yes; but I can let folks in.  
13 began to look attractive.  
Four delightful days followed.  
"I meant it for Cecy," she explained.  
It seems more appropriate."  
"Why, Phil, what made you say that?"  
I was thinking about it.  
And what is that about flies?  
It's a great compliment!"  
It's the easiest way."  
"No; he is out at the ranch.  
"Do you really go so soon?"  
It's a beautiful place.  
"There he is now," remarked Geoff.  
Lovers are like ostriches.  
"Then that's worth something, too.  
It made the long way seem short.  
But true love is not selfish.

Think the moor belonged to you?  
Lucky I had on my boots."  
"Not long enough to go through."  
"Where's Master Scarlett, sir?"  
"I don't know; neither of them."  
Perhaps it's full of gold."  
"They wouldn't have stopped; but you're right.  
That's the way to somewhere."  
She dare not in that best room."  
"No, no; it's wood burning.  
"But how are we to get in?  
It isn't deep enough to crawl."  
"Only a cobweb burning.  
"This cannot be a chimney?"  
"Look here; a lot of stone steps."  
"Think we'd better go back now."  
Let's go on to the end."  
HOW THE LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED.  
"And look at that old jackdaw's nest.  
Why, we might have a bed too."  
Why, Fred, this will be splendid.  
"They've never found their way here.  
Wish there were a fireplace.  
Shall we go any farther?"  
"Take hold of hands then, in case."  
"Shall we go any farther?"  
"I don't know," whispered back Fred.  
"Something has got hold of my jerkin."  
"Why, it's only that knob.  
So do you," was the reply.  
"What are you thinking about!"  
It was all so dark and strange."  
"Yes; you're not afraid, are you?"  
"Think we had better go now?"  
"I say, I know what it is.  
"Well, it looks like it," said Fred.  
"Shall we go any farther?"  
"Shall we go back and fetch one?"  
I mean up there in that room."  
not till we're tired of it.  
"Yes, of course, I see it now.  
"Will you come in, Forrester?"  
I was a little heated.  
"You were coming home with me?"  
Better come home now, my boy.  
"Very good, sir, very good.  
"Oh, Fred, what's the matter?"  
ANOTHER DISCOVERY.  
"But I mean the other end."  
It's very curious.  
"Why, don't you know what it is?"  
"I don't care; that's the sea.  
"I say, couldn't we get a boat?"  
"Oh yes, we could, with a rope.  
I'm ready if you are.  
Let us have one directly."  
"You want a rope, Master Fred?"  
I tell you I want the rope."  
"To make a swing with, of course.  
Fred stopped short, and rubbed one ear.  
I say, shall I go down first?"  
"Tie it tightly, Scar," cried Fred.  
I want to see what there is.  
"Aren't you at the bottom yet?"  
that's it," came from below.  
Why didn't you stand on one side?"  
"You can feel some wool down here.  
"Where was it you stepped over?"  
I can't see which way you mean."  
"I wish it wasn't dark," said Fred.  
Wait till I give it a jerk.  
Here, leave go for a moment."  
"There, I told you so," cried Fred.  
"I'm sure enough," said Fred, sulkily.  
"But suppose we do get down.  
You wait till I've found a place."  
"It's of no use," he said.  
Will you go down, or shall I?"  
"If you let that go we're done.  
you nearly knocked me over."  
How did you know we were here?"  
"Look here, Samson," cried Scarlett.  
"Go and get your garden line."  
"I wonder how this place came.  
what are you thinking about?"  
Now tie the stone to the line."  
"Good job, for there ain't much more."  
"Well, you can hear there is, lads.  
"Why, Samson, what do you mean?"  
"Going home, Master Scarlett?"  
"I don't know," said Fred, starting.  
"He would not lend it to us."  
"She has more than she wants now."  
"And we shall never find it."  
"That's always your way, Fred.  
Then aloud--"Very well, lad.  
"Serve me right for telling lies.  
Now then, what's the matter?  
Now try and draw yourself out."  
cried Scarlett, in agony.  
Now, I'll pull you if I can.  
I'll be up there in no time."  
Don't attempt to stir like that.  
THE SUBTERRANEAN WAY.  
Yes; I did not know how deep.  
"Then, why didn't we look there first?"  
The hesitation was gone.  
That word depth, too, troubled them.  
"Why, I never spoke," cried Scar.  
Don't you think we might go back?"  
Let's go to the end now.  
"Then you will not give it up?"  
"No," said Scarlett, doggedly.  
I mean when we've done with it."  
what's that--the end of it?"  
"Here are some steps and a door."  
"Just like the other we found."  
That one was toward the house.  
This one is toward the lake."  
Go on a bit faster, Scar."  
it's swimming towards you.  
"It seems very rum though, Scar.  
"I don't want to have to swim."  
"But it isn't all peace," said Fred.  
"What are you laughing at, Nat?"  
"You're just like our Samson."  
And talk about a temper!"  
That's what you always say."  
"What's the matter with him?"  
He'd like to hear, I dare say."  
"Yes, and I'll have the boat baled out.  
She's half full of water.  
"Been waiting for me, mother?"  
"Because I had mine with Scar.  
He'll make a good man, colonel.  
"Yes, father; like you have been."  
"I will, sir," said Fred, firmly.  
"No, nor you shall not, my boy.  
"But I don't know you yet, sir.  
You have not told me your name."  
Fred, my lad, I like your out-spoken ways.  
It was to try your mettle."  
"I will," thundered out the guest.  
"Wish I was going with him.  
"And Samson's just the same.  
I have to cheat him sometimes.  
"Here, let me have a turn now."  
"How are we to find it, then?  
"I'll tell you how to find it."  
"I will not be so shabby.  
"You're higher up than I thought.  
"Don't stop to try now," said Fred.  
"What does all this water mean?"  
"Where could it have come from, then?"  
"No; nor you without me, Fred."  
"Yes; it must be nearly time.  
Come up and have some with me."  
Well, how many have you caught?"  
"Not one, Nat," cried Fred, sharply.  
Show me where your lines are laid.  
"No; it wouldn't be any use."  
"That's what they can't make out.  
"Of course," cried Scarlett, laughing.  
"Now, then, which way shall we go?  
"No," said Fred; "it wouldn't be nice.  
said Sir Godfrey to himself.  
Well, Heaven's will be done!  
My duty is to my king."  
"I wonder what he came for?"  
he's all in a lather."  
"I think I know, Master Fred."  
And now I must hurry on."  
You are not going to fight."  
"It cannot be avoided.  
"You will be safe here," he said.  
THE BEGINNING OF TROUBLE.  
"But it is too horrible."  
"Is this my dear wife speaking?"  
From there, perhaps to Bristol."  
You'll break poor mother's heart."  
"I hear what you say, father."  
Lady Markham bowed her head.  
Sir Godfrey held up his hand.  
That's better, my darling.  
said Lady Markham, sadly.  
But why not have Black Adder?"  
"He will suit you better now.  
Don't go and leave me behind.  
"Nobody doubts that, my man."  
"Then let me go, Sir Godfrey.  
Sir Godfrey hesitated.  
You can take him if you wish."  
"No, sir," was the calm reply.  
"Earnest, Colonel Forrester.  
WARLIKE EXPERIENCES.  
"I don't think I have done much."  
I may want you before long."  
"When will it all be over?"  
Don't let one of them escape.  
Now, then, to horse and away!"  
"What do I want, Master Fred?  
Go and rest, and your horse too."  
"But this is nonsense, Samson.  
he asked of one of the men.  
A LESSON IN SELF-CONTROL.  
Nat turned upon him fiercely.  
"No, sir, not this time," he said.  
"It is your malignant spite.  
"No, no; I know that, Samson."  
Call a halt, sir, and fight him."  
"Wasn't afraid of him, was he?"  
Why, he don't know what it means!"  
faltered the young officer.  
Fred turned away angrily.  
"You see, sir, it's like this.  
You are too hot-headed, Master Scarlett.  
"The miserable coward!  
Two hours across the moor."  
"And you're not cross about it?"  
COMPANIONS IN MISFORTUNE.  
"Oh, they were taken again!  
"What's the matter, my lad?"  
"Then you are wounded, Samson?"  
But we shall soon mend again.  
I cannot recollect much."  
But it'll soon come back again."  
That's like him all over.  
Better than being like that."  
`'Course I will, master,' I says.  
That's how it was, Natty."  
"You always was a muddlehead, Natty.  
"That shows what I say 's right.  
You're proud enough as it is."  
It will be pleasanter then for us both."  
But haven't I seen you before?"  
"I thought I remembered you.  
The little inn near the moor."  
"I don't know what we are, sir.  
"Do you know where they have gone?"  
"It's of no use, father.  
How they are galloping now!"  
"They're taking him prisoner."  
Look, father; they're coming back."  
"Is it all over, father?"  
DISCOVERING THE TRAITOR.  
"Bad, father, bad," he murmured.  
I wish now I had been killed."  
"Yes," whispered the wounded lad.  
"And they are prisoners now?"  
We had no traitors with us."  
said the colonel, quietly.  
"You are sorry for him, then?"  
said the colonel, quietly.  
She's a foolish, wilful girl, sir.  
Don't believe a word she says."  
cried his child, clinging to him.  
he said, in a hoarse whisper.  
We shall know when we get there."  
What do they say in the camp?"  
ejaculated Fred, with his eyes brightening.  
said Samson, after a pause.  
Master's waving his hand."  
"Then, don't let's go, father."  
But shall we see my mother?"  
And Sir Godfrey, where was he?  
Lady Markham bowed coldly.  
cried the general, shortly.  
Lady Markham bowed once more.  
This meeting brought up the past.  
"Ask him--ask him," she whispered.  
Now I can feel more at rest."  
He has been most courteous.  
"Then what do you want, my boy?"  
They were not long in hearing.  
she whispered in a deep voice.  
said a gruff voice at the door.  
whispered Mistress Forrester.  
Saddle the pony, Samson.  
"But it seems so terrible.  
she said in a low, firm voice.  
"But if you are taken, Scar?"  
I shall go back as I came.  
"Don't--don't fidget, dear, like that.  
I tell you there is no risk.  
Fred Forrester's with them."  
"And when is he coming home?"  
Well, I must soon be going.  
the sentries may hear you speak.  
Have the goodness to open."  
"A ruse," said Scarlett, softly.  
"They do not know I'm here.  
"Come--leave my husband's house?"  
"You must," said her visitor.  
"Ah, you are hesitating!"  
What is this warfare to us?  
Then a damping thought occurred.  
"Which will you have, that or this?"  
Hence he was absolutely defenceless.  
What are you going to do?"  
Why, it aren't worth cutting off.  
"Do what any more, Samson?"  
"Wouldn't have let me, Master Fred?  
Why, you was more than brothers.  
"Ah, you don't know, Master Fred.  
"No, sir, nor nobody else.  
And that aren't the worst of it.  
"Because you are so hungry?"  
Then there was the cider, too.  
We must give way as they did to-day."  
"Will they attack us here, sir?"  
These are times of reverses.  
I suppose you were right, Fred.  
"Yes; right on, towards the Hall."  
We're enemies, don't you see?"  
Now I'm going to live.  
But let me look at your wounds."  
I did all I could to them.  
"Well, boy, pass the letter here."  
Rein back, if you are afraid."  
"Thank you," said Fred, haughtily.  
You're going wrong way, young man.  
SAMSON VISITS HIS BROTHER.  
Samson, get up; I want you.  
"I want you to come with me."  
Oh, I know; after rabbits.  
"Yes; I am going on there."  
"To cut the guytrash down, if I can."  
"Don't give me much pain, sir, now."  
"I couldn't bear to be moved, sir."  
What's the matter with you?  
"Did--did I say anything?"  
"There, take away that bucket."  
I want to ask you something."  
Are you in some great trouble?"  
said the colonel, with a sigh.  
You ought not to do this thing."  
There, I may as well tell you.  
"I am not in command here.  
I thought it would not be long.  
Only let me get a chance!"  
"Then you'd no business to, sir.  
Would you mind tying that, sir?"  
So you thought I was a spy?"  
cried Samson, excitedly.  
Look, sir; don't lose none of it.  
"IS THERE NOTHING WE CAN SAVE?"  
"You can't keep up at that pace.  
"What are they doing, father?"  
"Yes; they dragged us out in time.  
"Sir Godfrey?--Scarlett Markham?  
Did they escape right away?"  
"But where did you see them last?"  
Fighting bravely for their king."  
So full of brave manliness and courage.  
A capital blade, my boy.  
said a voice at his elbow.  
Even the big tool-house and fruit-room's burned.  
"All burned into ashes, sir.  
"Of Sir Godfrey and Scarlett?"  
"Yes, I hear what you say, sir."  
Oh, Samson, how horrible!  
"Don't 'ee take on, Master Fred, lad.  
"But I must, for I just would.  
"What, at the Manor, Samson?"  
"I don't know, Samson," said Fred, drearily.  
That's right, sir; come along."  
"Have I been to sleep, Samson?"  
"Oh, how stiff and cold I am!"  
You'll be as fresh as fresh soon.  
"No, sir; there's nothing there.  
"No, sir, I don't think it is."  
"Yes; I can tell by the touch.  
This aren't the place, I'm sure."  
He used to when we were boys."  
"You would be so obstinate.  
The twigs are all levelled down."  
"We cannot find him to-night, Samson."  
He'll find it when it's light."  
said Fred, after a long pause.  
"And besides, it is too soon.  
Some one may be watching us.  
"Yes, I know; but don't you see?"  
muttered Samson to himself.  
"You don't understand me, man."  
"I'm as clear-headed as you are, man.  
"Yes; some one has been through there."  
"Well, you stun me, Master Fred.  
"He found them, or they found him.  
"And them wanting our help."  
"Oh, I'll soon show you that, sir.  
I know him like a lesson.  
"Shall I bait the trap, then, sir?"  
"But we aren't got no lines, sir."  
Think the ruins will be cool?"  
"So was I, sir; and you oughtn't."  
cried Scarlett, excitedly.  
"I cannot leave you, father.  
But there was no time to lose.  
COMPANIONS IN MISFORTUNE.  
"I was puzzled and confused.  
"Her husband's enemies?"  
Sir Godfrey remained silent.  
"But you are badly hurt eh?"  
"Yes, yes, Nat; badly wounded.  
"Dreaming, Nat, my poor fellow!  
I dare say it's all right."  
Do you think you could crawl down?"  
"But--"  Scarlett stopped short, thinking.  
I'll draw you out of that place."  
"Take the food first, Master Scar.  
"But I aren't dead yet, dear lad.  
"Yes, sir; that's what I thought.  
How delightful it all was!  
"What are you laughing at, sir?"  
"Don't be a donkey, Samson."  
'Tarn't likely, you know, sir, 'tarn't likely."  
"Well, what's that--flint and steel?"  
"Of course I will, Master Fred.  
Samson was the first to speak.  
"Put up your sword; we are friends."  
"Then put up your own weapon."  
"I didn't know who might be here.  
"Is this some fresh treachery?"  
You wouldn't be such a coward.  
I say, where's Sir Godfrey?  
cried Scarlett, in anguished tones.  
"Yes, Samson; quite right," said Fred.  
"I'm afraid so, Samson."  
We may come any time now.  
"Good, sir, and a pair of shears."  
Did you see our Nat, sir?"  
"Yes, sir, if you get me leave."  
"And I will get the caps and cloaks."  
Not for a bit of a walk?"  
"I shall trick 'em now," he said.  
"Me trying to desert, sir!"  
cried Samson, indignantly.  
"But you were out of bounds, sir."  
"Go back to your quarters, sir.  
came from the back of the tent.  
I thought I heard some one call."  
Come along, and let's go."  
"We shall never get them there."  
"Shall I go first, Master Fred?"  
whispered Samson; "hear that, sir?"  
"I was ill and feverish.  
Never mind about that Nat.  
Got him all right, Master Fred?"  
"Your brother," said Fred, sharply.  
"Then you are released, Samson?"  
"Samson, are you sure of this?"  
This is your work--a surprise?"  
"No; going back to furren abroad."

"I say, Dave, what's this bird?"  
"Kill 'em all at one shot, Dave?"  
Here you, Jake, go and fetch it."  
"What's your Chip barking at?"  
"You boys don't make so much noise.  
"But it can't be good land, squire.  
"No, I don't think so, father."  
said the farmer, getting up.  
"You're all right up on the Toft.  
"My word, but the sea must bite to-night.  
"But you haven't got the powder."  
that flock of wild-geese going over?"  
"I know you believe in ghosts."  
Who cares about its being monky!  
Oh, I say, it is a shame!"  
"Why, to do all this draining.  
have a swim, you mean," said Tom.  
Why, there's a jack-o'-lantern on the road."  
Shall we let him light us home?"  
"Yes, father; we passed a fox."  
"Is it boggy and soft under you?"  
"No, only a few yards, boy.  
"What's the matter, father?"  
Yes, father, it _is_ the road.  
I saw it this afternoon."  
I say, isn't it getting dark!"  
cried the squire in agony.  
"I must swim, father," cried Dick.  
"You are safe, and your weight steadies me.  
"No, no, father," shrieked Dick; "left!"  
"But they've got the boat," cried Dick.  
But I nigh upon lost her.  
"Efter yow, squire," said the big fellow sturdily.  
"Will it come in again, then?"  
"Five or six feet deep, my boy."  
You are heartily welcome."  
"You'll be worse for it some day."  
said the two men in a breath.  
"Oh, mother, it's too bad!"  
We shall have to let you go."  
"You sold all your sheep last week."  
"Oh, you think so, do you, Dave?"  
It's years since I've been here.  
"How about your cottage, Dave?"  
"Not want the flood done away wi'!"  
Are you going to take us?"  
You wait a bit and we'll see.  
The man addressed shook his head.  
"And burned the whole forest down?"  
Get a rope round it and haul.  
Did you know we'd come for you?"  
A nasty ungrateful brute!  
That's what makes him vicious."  
"Take care, Tom; mind he don't bite!"  
"He can't bite with his hind-legs, can he?"  
"Why, I thought you said I ill-used him!"  
Here, catch hold of this harness.  
"What are you going to do?"  
But Solomon was too sharp.  
"He is beaten now," said Dick.  
That's right; buckle it on."  
"No, but he'd try all the same.  
"Yow can't say they weant do that."  
"Well, haven't I come for you, lad?"  
"There's plenty o' time, lad.  
"Oh, we'll do it directly!"  
"Now, Tom, boy, give it a heave.  
"He went in himself," cried Dick.  
"I'll try," said Dick eagerly.  
All right, I'm coming soon!"  
Dick did it unconsciously.  
Was he too going to drown?  
"Well, of all the ungrateful brutes!"  
"He's coming here, isn't he?"  
"Yes; I can see his old fox-skin cap.  
He's coming safe enough."  
"I don't want your share," said Dick loftily.  
"Let's think about the birds.  
He's just like an old fox.  
"I say, Dave, these nets are new."  
"Ay, every one of 'em.  
"What care I for a drop o' watter?"  
said Dave contemptuously.  
Gamecocks is babies to 'em.  
Got anything to eat, Dave?"  
said Dick after a long yawn.  
Only, wouldn't it be cruel?"  
ejaculated Dick with a sigh of relief.  
"But what did that bud do, lad?  
"I couldn't help missing," said Dick.  
The law is on our side.  
Well, squire, I thought I'd warn you."  
"Same man writ both, I should say."  
"Theer's my hand, squire," said Farmer Tallington.  
said Tom; "who'd mind a few frogs?"  
why, they're only lights," said Tom.  
"Look here, Dave, now no nonsense!  
"Nay, I don't want no poother," said Dave.  
Stay here while I go and look.  
whispered Dick excitedly.  
Now, not a word, and come on."  
I like to keep the 'coy quiet.  
whispered Dick as he followed.  
Going to help me kill 'em?"  
"Ready for another flock?"  
Ducks can't think like you and me.  
"He caught him," said Dave grimly.  
One as likes duck for dinner.  
If we can't theer's plenty more."  
"Only snarling," said the squire.  
"No, I don't, Dick," said the squire.  
You go that end, I'll do this.  
--rose in a confused babble.  
"Let's run faster," cried Dick.  
"Now, lads, all of you form line."  
"What is it, wench--what is it?"  
cried the squire, mounting once more.  
It was a glorious sight.  
"You are coming too, father?"  
"Try once more, father," said Dick.  
he said, as he struggled up.  
he added after a pause.  
"Had you been round there at all?"  
cried the squire indignantly.  
He's a hidin' behind them reeds.  
What are you going to do?"  
"You won't go without us, Dave?"  
"Nay, I don't want you, my lads."  
"Well, then, we want you," cried Tom.  
"Got everything ready, Dave?"  
"What's in that bucket, Dave?"  
cried Dick; "who said it was cold?  
"I say isn't it deep here, Dave?"  
"Nay, we've got to go quiet-like, my lad.  
"Caught any more in the 'coy, Dave?"  
Now, Dave, do let's begin."  
"Better than roach and rudd, Dave?"  
"No, you shall have first go, Tom."  
"Ay, lad, bud there be no hook."  
You've got it in your pocket."  
"Nay, he isn't worth trying for.  
no," cried the lads together.  
Longest way's sometimes gainest way."  
"Give her a few throosts, lad," he said.  
whispered Dick excitedly.  
Oh, what a fellow you are!"  
"Ah, he would be a big one!"  
"Didn't you feel him a bit, Tom?"  
There's one for you yonder."  
"Why, you've got hold of a stump!"  
"Nay, lad, I'll ketch up to un.  
cried Dick, whose face was scarlet.  
"Let me come this time, young Tom Tallington!"  
said Dave, grinning with pleasure.  
"I'm straange and glad you've caught him.  
One day he hed howd of a big duck.  
"It's a man's natur," said Dave.  
"She's reyther juicy this spring, eh?  
"We want Hickathrift's dog here," cried Dick.  
"Nay, yow want no dog," said Dave.  
"Easy enough to catch hares."  
"That isn't a heron," he said.  
Now, then: yonder's a hare."  
"Theer, she's a beauty, isn't she?"  
"Kill it, Dave, kill it," cried Tom.  
"How did you know it was there?"  
She's got a wife somewheers about."  
"There," he cried; "I told you so!  
"Now, then, goo and ketch her, lad."  
"Ay, lad, many as I like."  
I hev ketched rabbuds that ways, but not often.  
But it arn't done yet, lads, eh?"  
"No, it isn't done yet," said Dick.  
"I say, where's John Warren?  
"And I hope it will, my boy!  
"Mr Marston may be cold."  
My staff, mother," he added.  
"No, no, my lad; we can see.  
Not used to our parts," said Hickathrift.  
"Very sorry, Mester Dick."  
Go and send one of the men."  
"No, father; leaden bullet."  
"I don't think you ought to talk."  
"Don't know," said the squire shortly.  
"But they might borrow, father?"  
he roared--"a hundred to one!"  
"Well done, young un--so he is!"  
Who was it fired that shot?  
[sea-fog--mist from the German Ocean.]  
Heered aught yet 'bout him as did it?"  
"No, my man, and don't want to."  
What are you going to do to-day?"  
"Mester Hickathrift has got the stong-gad to mend.  
"'Bout two hours--mebbe only one.  
"You never mind about that!  
"What curious fish were they?"  
"Nay, yow wean't catch them here," said Dave oracularly.  
Our watter here's clean and clear."  
That's the way to catch him."  
"Want to turn back and give up?"  
Oh, Dave, we shall lose them all!"  
"Some on 'em's safe to go.  
"Oh, I say, Tom, what a game!  
"Now, my lads, all together.  
"What are you going to do?"  
"Nay, my net would break," said Dave.  
"We're mates, that's what we are.  
"But do you know who it was?"  
"Yes, my man, very much so.  
You say it was while you slept."  
"That basket," said Dick briskly.  
Dick glanced at Marston and laughed.  
"No; they're out of season, John!"  
"Why, you ungrateful beggar!"  
"Do you want me to kick you?"  
Is that Decoy Dave's place?"  
"That's it, and there's Chip!"  
"That's kindly, Mester Dick.  
said Mr Marston, kindly.  
Only a shivering fit."  
"Straange and thick to-night, Mester Dick," said Dave.  
"Feel how cold and damp it is."  
"Nowt much, sir," said the man smiling.  
cried the squire, excitedly.  
Do you hear what he says, Tom?  
"It is not anybody."  
Mark my words, they don't like it."  
"Nay, lads, I'm not laughing.  
"Didn't go to the doctor, lad."  
"What did you go to him for?"  
"Why, he had no bones broken.  
"Well, is it getting better, Hicky?"  
"But I wouldn't stop late, my lads."  
Come, tell the truth now--weren't you?"  
"What is it--anything good?"  
"That depends on taste, my boy.  
"But the wood's sound," cried Tom.  
"It can't be so old as that."  
The peat preserves the wood, Tom.  
"Theer's what I promised you, lad.  
"What's got to be done now?"  
I was having such a dream!"  
"That's old Billy," said Dick.  
"And how are we to get back?"  
Has anybody done this?"  
Here, go and call up the men.  
And do you hear, all of you?"  
"No; I saw him come," said Tom.  
"Says he's sorry for it!"  
cried Tom, who looked very pale.  
"There, he's laughing at you.  
He thinks I houghed the poor horses.  
A constable is sworn in."  
"What difference does that make?"  
I say, let's serve him out!"  
I should like to serve him out."  
But his back was beautiful.  
cried Dick, shaking himself free.  
"'Tisn't," said Dick; "it's a snake.  
Oh, I am hot and thirsty!  
"Oh, what a bait for a pike!"  
said Tom, "a bit at a time."  
Don't make a noise; let's watch.  
Perhaps they've found something else."  
"No," said the young engineer.  
"No: he has gone home," said Dick.  
I thought he would get away."  
"Shall I go away, father?"  
"And who do you think it was?"  
"Or offenders," said the squire drily.  
"No, but I heard them quite plain."  
"Smugglers and a king's ship!"  
"What are you doing here, sir?  
said Mr Marston again.  
But I didn't mean any harm."  
"Then don't let's go with them.  
I should have liked to go though."  
what did Mr Marston say?"  
I think it weer a fireball."  
"Fireball come down, I think."  
Seems straange and disappointed, lads.  
"Hah, there's something in that!"  
"To make the job last longer."  
"Why, it's Thorpeley, the constable!"  
said Dave with a little laugh.  
"No; you speak out now," cried Dick.  
"He's a regular sham."  
"But what will your father say?"  
"But how about your mother?"  
"Oh, I am disappointed!"  
It'll be a lesson to him."  
"Why, who can be shooting now?"  
whispered Tom excitedly.  
I'm tired and hungry.  
"What is it then--a fox trapped?"  
"It's something queer," said Tom huskily.  
"It is something horrible!"  
"It's someone in distress."  
But I don't believe it is.  
"You mean after _him_," said Dick.  
said Tom in a doubting tone.  
"You're such a doubting fellow!"  
It was a marsh cry, and--oh!"  
he cried; "what's the matter?"  
"No, we sha'n't if we are careful.  
The man's bleeding to death."  
Look here, send for the doctor."  
Now, tell us all about it."  
"But that man says--" cried the squire.  
Hickathrift's was a curious laugh.  
"I've made up my mind to go."  
What's the good o' my punt?  
It will all come right at last."  
One hour--two hours passed.  
"I can't go," he said softly.  
The thought was quite exciting.  
"Which way did your father go?"  
I say, shall I go back now?"  
"Ay, that's a true word," cried Hickathrift.  
Let's keep together, please."  
"You'd scare your mother to dead.  
The doctor will save his life."  
Bud don't you fret, Mester Dick.  
"And did you see it, mester?"  
exclaimed the doctor as he dismounted.  
"No," said the latter sternly.  
I can get him to," cried Tom.  
"Stop a moment, Dick Winthorpe," he said.  
I ask you, then, who this was.  
"But you keep trying to be."  
"Have you told your father, then?"  
"But he struck me," panted Dick.  
But Dick had no cause for fear.  
"Why didst na let him hev it again?"  
"What's the use o' shuting at a sperrit?"  
"But someone ought to see it."  
what's the good o' doctors?  
Going out in the morning?"  
"It's young Tom Tallington, Mester Dick.  
"Here," he cried, "Dick Winthorpe, come along.  
"But how are we to get there?"  
It must be at Dave's, eh?"  
"Yes, it's there, sure enough.  
"Nay, they coom i' pattens," said Dave sharply.  
I fired and I heered a squeal.  
They might have left me alone.  
Look, dessay that's them burning now.  
"Over at John Warren's.  
You couldn't when it's frozen.  
"Yes, but I mean about you.  
The rough fellow shook his head.  
"Keep on thy coat, lad, I wean't hev it.  
But, theer, you two had best go back."  
That star's reight over the Toft.  
How tense is every nerve!  
"We should if we stopped," said Dick.  
shouted Hickathrift as he peered around.  
I must speak plainly, Marston.  
"They are," said the squire gravely.  
"Nay, nay, ghosts is ghosts, and sperrits is sperrits."  
"I nivver did till now, Mester Dick."  
"Thowt you lads 'd like to see," he said.  
Yow can't get shut of sperrits that ways.  
Do they call them stoats in London?"  
"I am sure of it, my lad.  
"Say, Mester Dick, on'y think of it!  
"Then it was no accident, Hickathrift?"  
said the big fellow thickly.  
"Hicky," he said softly; "be a man!"  
What time shall you be ready?"  
"You can't," said Tom; "it's too boggy."  
Only got to pick your way.  
I say, Hicky, may I have the punt to-morrow?"  
Nay, nay, theer's no shooting now."  
That would never do, my lad.  
Don't say such a word as that."  
"What an idiot I was!"  
he said to himself at last.  
It must be the huts of the drain-makers.  
Oh, if he could but have seen!  
"Close round here somewhere," said Dick.  
"Go on and we shall find it.  
The place is nearly burned down."  
"Ay, squire, we will," cried Hickathrift; "and afore long."  
There must be no violence."  
said Mr Marston sternly.  
"But he can't be shot," said Tom.  
Hearty, Mester Dick, bless you!  
"Rheumatism, Hicky; that's all.  
"Ay, it's the owd poont, Mester Dick.  
"How old was he, do you think, Hicky?"  
You never liked the donkey."  
Of course; but come--you do know?"  
"Ah, well, I will not press you, Hicky!

TROLLING FOR BLACK BASS                                  233  CHAPTER XXIV.  
MAKING A FLORIDA PORT.  
"That's all right," I added.  
"I think we need another.  
This is the first day of March.  
Where is that bloody contract?  
"Certainly not," I replied.  
"Provisions means grub, don't it?"  
A NATIVE FLORIDIAN.  
"Thank you, Mr. Cornwood," I replied.  
I asked, when we were seated.  
exclaimed the fair young lady.  
"I haven't the least idea.  
"What's the reason I won't?"  
MOONLIGHT AND MUSIC ON BOARD.  
"What a lovely little room!"  
"I have a letter for you."  
I asked, rather anxiously.  
The instrument was well played.  
"It is perfectly charming!"  
Of course Owen went with the Shepards.  
I halted to look at him.  
Don't talk to me about cuttin' up!  
"Run down yourself, you old fool!"  
A BATTLE WITH THE SERPENT.  
I was willing she should shout.  
"You abominable wretch!"  
"Don't tell me such a ry-dicerlous story!  
I don't believe a word on't.  
"I don't believe a word on't!"  
"What sort of a snake was it?"  
I cal'late this was one of his snakes."  
There were two from my father.  
"Good evening, Captain Alick," said he.  
That's the whole of it, sir."  
But I think he is a snake."  
"Griffin brought off Cornwood in a boat."  
This is out of pure revenge.  
I don't care to go snaking.  
"Are you not afraid of them?"  
"It is fifteen miles from here."  
"We will go to Mandarin.  
demanded my passenger.  
asked my facetious cousin.  
demanded my passenger.  
Shove it off on the Colonel!"  
"You sent for me, and I came."  
"Give heed to my charms, Mr.  
GRIFFIN LEEDS AT A DISCOUNT.  
I looked about for his shoes.  
"What is the old trick, Mr.  
"Where was Mr. Brickland at that time?"  
yelled the octoroon, with a savage oath.  
"You did try to murder me!"  
Obey your order, Mr.  
"No doubt at all about it.  
"All right, Buck;" and the deck-hand retired.  
He asked me if I had found Cobbington.  
Cornwood led the way over the long foot-bridge.  
It looked like a stick of wood.  
"What was your business at home?"  
My health was pretty good then.  
You will take the wheel, Mr. Cornwood.  
A VISIT TO ORANGE PARK.  
I hope you are very well."  
"Is that man employed on board?"  
"How long has he been on board?"  
"He came on Saturday night."  
FISHING IN DOCTOR'S LAKE.  
"Oh, isn't that magnificent!  
asked Owen, seriously.  
"Do you call that a big one?"  
"How long have you been married?"  
"Only when he is ashore.  
"Never heard of him before."  
An old mill stood by the shore.  
Let us get away from here!"  
He was about five feet long.  
"What do you aim at, Mr.  
Miss Nellie must go with them.  
I left my room and went aft.  
What sort of a craft is she?"  
Cornwood had struck the bell, and the paddle-wheel stopped.  
screamed Chloe, with energy.  
"Just as you please," I replied.  
"Not more than nine or ten miles."  
"The ladies can't walk nine miles."  
I told them what had happened.  
"Where is the turkey you shot?"  
asked Ben, when Cornwood had gone ashore.  
"Take your hand from your pocket!"  
I pointed my gun at him.  
I pointed at Griffin Leeds.  
"Let him march ahead of us."  
I had not seen you before.

A Note about the Author.  
His serenity vanished.  
But what of the fair little charioteer?  
I wonder it didn't kill  
him.  
the  
poor, poor boy!--the dear boy!  
"That will do, Balls, you may go.  
There, now, don't  
begin to cry.  
It was not a pleasant face.  
She drew back and let him pass.  
Then another man appeared.  
His face seemed  
a jolly one.  
gasped the burly little man.  
he was so  
different--once!"  
almost shouted the husband.  
"You haven't murdered it, have  
you?"  
"If you did I'd bang your nose!  
An' who sent for  
the doctor?  
Did the doctor ask a fee?"  
"Of course you've paid the ninepence, Hetty?"  
"Yes, Mrs Loper, it moves.  
Just look at its solemn eyes.  
"And with only 500 pounds a year?"  
objected Mr Twitter.  
We are _rich_ with five  
hundred.  
"And entertain our friends?"  
"All true, Mariar, and all _your_ doing.  
I shall be on for a month."  
He's _not_ dead after all!"  
she asked, with  
touching pathos.  
Sir Richard agreed to wait.  
"Are they then so violent?"  
Mother, here's Mr Scott.  
Does it feel _very_ painful?  
he said looking  
round the room.  
But he's knocked  
over now."  
But Hetty  
works like a horse.  
"I beg your pardon--how much?"  
"No, sir, I mean one shillin' a _week_.  
He could ride that, I suppose?"  
You'll have to return alone."  
Welland grasped the proffered hand.  
"Come, you are doubly welcome.  
--"I say, Robin, I'm gettin' tight."  
--"It is an  
amazing sight."  
Lilly, 'eaven is quite different."  
Her husband had fallen sick.  
Soon there was a crowd round the  
school-door.  
"Not enough of money, dear."  
It 'as never bin  
different."  
You see, I can't 'old hout  
agin 'im.  
That night Bob Frog stood with his dosser, (i.e.  
Besides, she ain't yer mother!"  
Tim was  
observant also.  
"No more, thank you, Sir Richard."  
said a voice at his elbow.  
"Ned," said she, "I'm tired."  
Don't it mind you of the  
courtin' days?"  
"The larder windy, my boy."  
Couldn't you let me  
'ave a feed first?"  
Why do you take me  
so sharp?  
Molly, dear, you are unjust.  
"Nay, Molly, I can prove it.  
"You are wrong, dear Mrs Frog.  
You cannot speak while you are famishing.  
"It's of no use, Hetty.  
Bobby, dear, don't steal again."  
Beggin' might be tried with advantage.  
The poor old lady grew pale.  
"Wot, bin at it again, mother?"  
"What--what--what's to do _now_, Mariar?"  
shouted all three with a gasp.  
"Where are your boys, may I ask?"  
His voice is no longer  
gruff.  
Welland had not observed him.  
"Well, that is a clergyman.  
"Run, young fellow, you know the  
fire-station!"  
Giles was quick to understand.  
THE OCEAN AND THE NEW WORLD.  
only to some small extent.  
That same day a whale was seen.  
Piggie was wrong in admitting that.  
But little Mouse did not "bust."  
"I hope not, Bob," he replied.  
But we may not pause long here.  
Soon the little Mouse was caught.  
The boys won't mind that, you know.  
Good-morning, and as tidy as two pins.  
Sit  
beside me, little one."  
No  
idlers on Brankly Farm, I can tell you.  
More tea,  
Susy," (to his wife).  
Also I slep' under  
railway-arches, and on door-steps.  
Go, and see what you can do."  
"An' who's your real father?"  
Bob, don't forget your purliteness," said Tim.  
"Come, Mumpy;  
father calls you Mumpy, doesn't he?"  
Let me see where shall we be?"  
It's not difficult here.  
said Bobby, with decision.  
And Bobby _was_ satisfied.  
Mrs Frog was quite willing.  
There were opponents and sympathisers  
there.  
Are they not superabounding in energy?  
What is enthusiasm?  
Follow him to the  
races.  
"But follow him still further.  
It is a huge audience.  
A great star is to  
appear.  
And what of our cynic?  
The twelve months will be out then.  
i shuvd im in the  
river wun dai.  
sai we'll never forgit wot they told us.  
That is my message to him.  
And now, how is my Mita?  
"Yes, Mrs Twitter, I will; good-night."  
he said, offering his hand.  
"No peace there," he said, sternly.  
I wants to _give_ you  
money."  
Now, Ned, will you take the job?  
Reggie North, can that be you?"  
I'd like to come and see you."  
"That's just what I am, Ned."  
he said, going up to him.  
said Ned, wheeling round, sternly.  
Thus the small table  
was full.  
I'm _so_ glad you've brought her.  
"You are heartily welcome.  
"Certainly, and most welcome."  
"How d'you know he's not willing?"  
My bonnet and shawl, Molly!"  
"How did you know I'd left him?"  
"Not much," said North, with a grin.  
THE RETURNING PRODIGAL.  
But _we_ must not forget the Twitters.  
But Sammy could not reply.  
You didn't use--to--be--so--slow!  
I haven't undressed  
much of late."  
"It--it's not too hot--eh?"  
Two  
young men and a young girl.  
Why, these are two "waifs" and a "stray!"  
Pretty engineers you are.  
Glorious weather, isn't it?"  
that _will_  
be a day for me!"  
Anyway, he is coming.  
Sir Richard has changed his mind!  
"Well, I'll do it five times, Tim.  
Bob saw her, but did not move.  
By no means," said Tim, quickly.  
"An' you calls the 'osses _bay_ 'osses, do you?"  
Now then, Hetty--come, Matty.  
"May God help him--dear father!"  
He became disorderly.  
By  
their fruits shall ye know them.  
Ned gave a cynical laugh.  
"An' wot 'ave _you_ got to do with it?"  
"Not before breakfast, Bobby?"  
demanded the old street boy.  
Bob pulled out half-a-crown and offered it.  
"Why don't you take it, my boy?"  
"Thank God for sendin' you back to me."  
But I  
don't feel like that now.  
His wife's name is Martha.  
"They'd make such splendid backwoodsmen," says one.

"What a neat little speech, Ned!"  
"True enough," he said, laughing.  
But Zoe said not a word.  
"And that is all I ask, love.  
"How good in you to say it!"  
unless you much prefer it.  
he asked, turning to Edward.  
Zoe colored angrily.  
exclaimed Zoe gratefully.  
"That's too bad," said Ella.  
"To the village, if you like.  
Ella and Ben saw it too.  
Didn't you hear Arthur say so?"  
asked Miss Deane impatiently.  
"Have they sent for his mother?"  
"May I go to him at once?"  
"Tell me the old, old story."  
"I will try to make it plain.  
"If I could only see him!  
"Betty tells me the same thing.  
"Really, would you believe it?  
"Is that quite heartless in me?"  
"Dear Ned, my own dear husband!"  
she said, hugging him tighter.  
"What can I do for you, dear?  
he remarked, knitting his brows.  
"How did you leave them  
all at Viamede?"  
"As is but fair," said Arthur.  
exclaimed Zoe, in delight.  
Shall I order the horses?"  
They were cantering homeward as they talked.  
"Mamma, dear, dearest mamma!"  
"Ok, no, no, mamma Vi!  
I  
wish a letter would come!"  
"Shall I help you change your dress?"  
"Why, of course I should," he said.  
"No, it was not that--not now.  
A horrid Italian too!"  
"I'd never call him father!"  
how good and kind you all are!"  
Not till after we go North.  
"Yes: mamma Vi says I am.  
It's good in them, isn't it?"  
"How terrible is passion!"  
"How dare you, Lulu Raymond!"  
"But who left it lying there?"  
"What is the matter, children?"  
"Is it only you,  
Gracie?"  
she asked with a burst of  
sobs.  
I didn't do it on purpose!  
what ails our  
little one?"  
the captain said, in moved tones.  
The captain mused a moment.  
"Such a darling as she is!"  
the pretty pet that she is!"  
don't punish her very hard.  
"What would his anger be like?"  
I am in despair of you!  
What am I to do with you?  
"I'll never do it again."  
Do you not think I was right?"  
"No, sir, nor dinner either.  
"Is there any change, doctor?"  
Their hands met in a warm clasp.  
she murmured as he  
drew near.  
"'Ask, and it shall be given you.'  
"What is the matter,  
daughter?"  
"Papa's dear little girl!"  
she returned,  
hugging him tight.  
Her face had grown radiant.  
And what would be done to her?  
he replied with emotion.  
"I am sure I should," said Max.  
he exclaimed, "you are not well."  
I will take you for a walk."  
"You are not able to walk.  
how good God has been to us!"  
"Can you spare me a moment?"  
"Of course not," said Evelyn.  
She considered a moment.  
they all exclaimed in a breath.  
Raymond met "grandma Elsie."  
The captain grasped it warmly.  
"No, my dear, I know you didn't."  
'And they that stumbled are girded with strength.'  
"And it is really for sale?"  
Will you redeem my  
promise?"  
Will you go with me, my dear?"  
she asked in an undertone.  
"Papa, it will be _so  
nice_!"  
"You don't care a bit, _do_ you?"  
"Aunt Elsie, I do love her!  
But I wouldn't dare to ask it."  
"When can we move in, papa?"  
"Very well; let me hear them."  
she asked, half under her breath.  
"And show it to you, papa?"  
he asked, catching sight of the blank-books.  
Evelyn looked on, well pleased.  
"And I'll do the same," said Max.  
"Did you hire it for  
me?"  
queried Lulu eagerly.  
for here we are at Woodburn."  
"Yes, sir: that was why I asked.  
Rosie asking, "Whose is he?"  
"But is it a pleasant room?"  
she asked in a low  
aside.  
She flushed, and cast down her eyes.  
She ran to open the door.  
She gave him a wistful look.  
Not mamma  
Vi, I suppose?  
"Papa, where is the schoolroom?  
"I will show it to you now."  
is there something more to see?"  
"Oh, yes, I want to see that!  
They were all three asking it.  
"And I third it," added Grace.  
"Directed, you mean, Agnes.  
"But we are strong and healthy."  
Why, Lu, what more could you ask?"  
"The lovely, precious darling!"  
We must have them lighted first.  
Does  
everybody consent?"  
It was all settled at last.  
"But you will help me with that?"  
"Why, no, papa, of course not."  
She gave him a frightened look.  
"We like school, papa," said Grace.  
"Nor I," cried the other two.  
"Now see how  
many you have."  
"I'd rather stay with Gracie.  
"They're ever so good and kind!  
and what favored children now!  

## elsiesnewrelations.txt  

"Oh, how very beautiful!"  
"You are not afraid of me?"  
he queried,  
with a pleased smile.  
Where did you get this, Lulu?"  
"Please, papa, don't punish him.  
So I shall not punish him.  
"Yes, indeed we do, papa!"  
"With my hand in yours, papa.  
"I bought it at a news-stand, papa."  
Do you read it often,  
Max?"  
"O papa, don't be so grieved!  
Haven't we had a nice time, Max?  
"Why, how you are trembling!"  
Nobody else has a right!"  
"I'll try to behave better."  
Max asked in trembling tones.  
she asked in an undertone.  
"Both, I should say," laughed Edward.  
she asked, with a troubled look.  
"Yes, sir, I suppose they would.  
The captain turned toward them.  
Vi considered a moment.  
Max's and Grade's and mine?  
And may I help you with them?"  
"Indeed we do, Mamma Vi!  
"We must watch and pray, my child.  
he asked, looking round at her.  
"You will come down to supper?  
Violet said heartily.  
"Oh, I have eyes and can see!  
Now lie down and go to sleep.  
It is his and it is mine."  
"Yes, indeed, dearest mamma.  
"For all winter, I think, dear.  
And so we will, won't we,  
dear?"  
"The more need to learn then, dear.  
"Isn't it nice, Grandma Elsie?"  
"How very pretty, Zoe!"  
"Zoe, Zoe, where are you?"  
But she is almost as good."  
"May we come in, Mamma Vi?"  
Max asked, with a wistful look.  
"I will help you at the start.  
cried Lulu vehemently.  
"Would you like to begin now?"  
"I don't know  
how to begin!"  
Cousin Ronald Lilburn is coming.  
Maybe he will be here by to-morrow.  
They met in the lower hall.  
"Company," remarked Zoe.  
"Yes, I know he did," said Max.  
Walter did as directed.  
"Oh, here it comes after me!  
there's the old hen Max brought!"  
"And  
what do you think of those?"  
"May we  
go close up, mamma?"  
I'd rather think of pleasanter subjects.  
I think I'm the richest."  
"Yes, I think I do," he said.  
and to me to be so called.  
"Yes, foolish child that I was!"  
"But the house is not the same."  
Elsie asked,  
turning to him.  
"Grandpa, can't she be let out?"  
the lassie's no there, eh?"  
you'll frighten him," whispered Ralph.  
Just then the doctor came in.  
Sam had met him in the hall.  
"Tell him it isn't dangerous.  
What for you s'pose she done do  
dat?"  
"Kase I seed you, he, he, he!"  
Gracie, too, cried bitterly.  
And Jesus is a  
Saviour from sin.  
So you must go and leave me."  
You are better than I am.  
So you needn't mind my knowing."  
"O Gracie, that _was_ wicked!  
"Did you give him leave, Elsie?"  
did he do something wrong, too?"  
she said inquiringly,  
with a pleading look.  
"I say it's just shameful!  
abominable treatment!  
You oughtn't to have come in here."  
she exclaimed indignantly.  
he asked, with suppressed anger.  
He watched her for a moment.  
"Why, what do you mean, Rosie?"  
The cloud lifted from his brow.  
She was not there or in the dressing-room.  
I am ashamed of myself!  
Zoe colored with pleasure.  
The hour was almost up.  
"Can't you set matters straight, then?"  
"You asked what I'd been doing.  
she said, offering her lips.  
shall I get ready at once?"  
But why did you ask  
Miss Deane?  
She'll spoil all my enjoyment."  
"What do you mean by that, sir?  
"Zoe, what mad prank is this?  
Let me help you down at once."  
Go at  
once to your room, sir.  
"Zoe, how pretty you are!  
he asked in a freezing tone.  
"Oh, I do, I do hate it!"  
he cried out with vehemence.  
He cogitated a moment, then began.  
I'd like to see you try it!"  
She hushed her sobs and listened.  
"I haven't a doubt of that, dear.  
"Did you obey your husband?"  
"Then he never ordered you?"  
"Is my husband much like him?"  
murmured Zoe with a sigh.  
such a dear mother to me!  
"I wish I didn't love him so.  
he said, "is it possible!  
I love you  
dearly, dearly!  
"Oh, I'm so glad, so glad!"  
"But how was I brought up here?  
"Barely ten dollars," he said.  
he exclaimed with emotion.  
"Would you have looked for me, Ned?"  
he exclaimed with  
energy.  
"I wish I was going, too!"  
I'm so sorry for  
you."  
it'll just make him feel badly.  
"I do mean to," Lulu said.  
A CHAPTER OF SURPRISES.  
"Glad to see you so, also.  
I almost wish it was mine."  
Did you come to take us home?"  
"Can this be my baby girl?  
"But where are Max and Lulu?"  
"Well, Max, my son, what is it?"  
Many, many  
thanks, dear Ned!"

THE EXPLOSION AT THE VAUGHAN,             222     XXIV.  
CONCLUSION,                               298       ILLUSTRATIONS.  
"There's blood on thy hands, Bill.  
Thou'st's had a hard two days on't.  
I ha' tould you so scores o' times.  
What be you staring at, Jack?  
"Coom here," the miner said to Jack.  
"I wa'n't going to speak," Jack said.  
What did 'ee hit I and Bess for?  
"Ha' ye got another strap?"  
"Well, lad, what are you doing?"  
"And why do they call you Bull-dog, Jack?"  
Why, he's a gentleman."  
My case is something like it.  
"Oi'm thinking o' getting larning."  
Good-bye, Harry, I'll see thee to-night."  
CHAPTER V.  SETTING TO WORK.  
"What, is that you, Jack Simpson!"  
What time have you to study?  
So you must not give up play.  
I'll make a note of his name."  
A sort of low cry came up.  
Thou art shamed by this lass here.  
"Go down, to be sure," Jack said.  
"Catch hold o' th' windlass."  
He was growing very weak.  
He was himself again now.  
I thought only o' Harry.  
Where be ye, Nelly Hardy?  
What is she a doing now?"  
If it would she'd be welcome.  
"What dost want, Harry Shepherd?  
"No, Jack," she said, colouring.  
Jack sat thoughtful for some time.  
"Why, it be Nelly Hardy!"  
"Well, ye be cleaned up surely."  
She's got the sense o' one.  
and the pluck, and I like her.  
"Let's try him," one boy said.  
"All right, try away," Jack said.  
He grows a proper lad that."  
Who'd take 'ee to be a pitman?"  
There is no greater mistake.  
At first things always look well.  
"Well, mother, and how goes it?"  
"Ah, Jack, lad, how be it with 'ee?"  
"All right, dad; getting on well.  
I've been for it all along."  
"Why did you not write to me?"  
he asked, almost angrily.  
"It is awful, sir, awful.  
Will you do that for me, sir?"  
"They are mad," Jack said sternly.  
"You may risk your life, Harry."  
"Is there anything else, Jack?"  
"Only about fifteen pounds.  
You've got some unions, haven't you?"  
"That be my business," Jack said.  
I don't want to do you harm.  
Girls' wind ain't as good as lads'."  
"Not for a moment," Jack said.  
"You will try, Jack, you will try.  
Jack looked astonished again.  
"Two or three nights a week, Jack.  
"What a sight o' things thou know'st, Jack!"  
"And thou really lik'st reading, Jack?  
I hate it," John Jordan said.  
Several of the lads looked irresolute.  
Four others agreed to join.  
No talking to be allowed.  
But be'est sure it be true, Sally?"  
"Ah, indeed," Mr. Brook said.  
"Do you want a dress suit, sir?"  
the foreman asked with suppressed merriment.  
"Let us go another way."  
"I'll take 'ee," Bill Haden answered.  
"So do I," Mr. Brook said.  
"Can you advise anything?"  
It was a glorious day.  
At last silence was restored.  
"Jim," she called in a loud voice.  
Jack said in astonishment.  
Mr. Dodgson said, coming forward.  
"What is the matter with him?"  
"There are no thanks due, my dear.  
he said in astonishment.  
"No, lasses are strange things," Jack meditated again.  
"People are fools," Jack burst out wrathfully.  
"Who should know it before you?"  
"I know," the young fellow said.  
THE EXPLOSION AT THE VAUGHAN.  
Jack looked immensely surprised.  
"Could you work out the cube-root of say 999,888,777?"  
"How on earth did you do that?"  
"He would not have it told, sir.  
"What am I to do, Mr.  
"A little more steam," Jack said.  
Does the bell act, I wonder?"  
There are three men at work there."  
They looked astonished at the new-comers.  
I thought thou'd'st scarce come round again."  
"Can you suggest nothing, Jack?"  
your clear head may save us yet."  
"What o'clock is it now, sir?"  
for I've lost all count of time."  
"How much powder have you, Bill?"  
She looked up, and saw Harry.  
"Is your father down, Harry?  
My brother Willy is down.  
This was on Thursday morning.  
Mr. Hardinge exclaimed, in surprise.  
Presently this died away.  
"What on earth can have happened?  
Let us lower a light down."  
"It be gunpowder smoke, sir!"  
It is impossible, Jack.  
Then the funerals began.  
I am a very young man.  
And now I have said my say.  
I'm main proud o' that lad."  
he exclaimed indignantly.  
"What should I do wi'out my work, Jack?  
But I needn't work at a stall.  
he asked; "I shall be lost here.  
Better now than ten years on."

"How many'd you have, Polly?"  
said Polly, decidedly.  
but wouldn't it cost money, though!"  
"No, not forever-an'-ever," said Polly; "take care, Phronsie!  
"I know," said Polly; "oh dear!  
"The stove'll act like everything, to-morrow!  
"Now, whatever shall we do!"  
There, you ugly old thing, you!"  
You mustn't borrow trouble, child."  
said Polly; "I can't thank you!  
"We shall have to tie it on."  
then we'll get something to eat!"  
went back again from Polly.  
"What are you staring at, Joe?"  
ejaculated Joel; "when did I have 'em?  
"Oh, Phronsie," she said, reprovingly; "you ought not to.  
cried Phronsie; "I want some now, I do!"  
"Come on, Joe; you've got to pile to-day."  
"Phronsie, you're no bigger than a mouse!"  
a pile of saucers followed.  
"Yes, truly--every day."  
repeated Miss Jerusha.  
"Why, it's Polly Pepper!"  
She had something in her arms.  
"What'll the boys say, I wonder!"  
"I thought so too," said Polly.  
"Something the matter with Ben!"  
Polly stitched away bravely.  
"Oh, Joe, you didn't stop to play?"  
"Where's my dinner, Polly?"  
"Didn't you feel badly before?"  
said grandma; "and this girl too?"  
laying her hand on Phronsie's head.  
he asked, watching her crunch it.  
cried Phronsie, with a very wise look.  
"Why, I can't," said Ben; "twouldn't sound true."  
"Isn't there any molasses, mammy?"  
"A con--" repeated Polly.  
asked Polly, "just like Mr.  
"Joel," said Polly, "be still."  
Such a girl as you are, too!"  
Joel's goin' to get well!"  
"Oh, I want something to eat!  
"I guess so," laughed his mother.  
asked Ben, tossing her up high.  
said Ben, to one of the men.  
cried Polly, "that ever breathed!  
screamed little Phronsie, "see him, Polly!  
come here, poor little monkey!"  
I can't see mother's face!"  
Then away home to mother!  
Polly alone, clung to hope!  
you ought to have seen him run!"  
"And this is Prince," he added.  
"Oh, you splendid fellow, you!"  
asked the boy with interest.  
"I should think not," laughed Jasper.  
said the boy, enviously.  
is anybody hurt, Ben?"  
"No, don't give 'em away, ma!"  
"How glad Jasper'll be, won't he, mamsie?"  
"How did Jasper begin his?"  
cried Polly, with a wry face.  
and she looked ready to cry.  
I told you, Ben, I couldn't write."  
"Can we ever get it out, mammy?"  
"I don't know," said her mother.  
"The ugly old pen did it!"  
"Yes, here I am," said Jasper.  
he added admiringly.  
said Jasper; "don't you think it!  
asked the child in grave delight.  
said Polly, "I'm so glad!"  
"Mrs. Blodgett put 'em on."  
And then they had the baking!  
I should like to know why not?"  
"Oh get a pail of water!"  
"Is that the same as Jasper?"  
"Yes, the very same," he said.  
"Is this little Miss Pepper?"  
"Oh, Phronsie," began Mrs. Pepper.  
"And you must answer 'em all."  
he responded eagerly.  
"But first, Ben, what let's do?"  
"I should think likely," laughed Ben.  
"No, indeed, Polly Pepper!  
"Will he be black like Joey?"  
"Yes," said Ben, "just twice as fast."  
"See if you've got some--look quick!"  
"Oh, Ben, did you lock the door?"  
"Do, Polly, do," begged Joel.  
"Isn't it growing awful dark?"  
aren't we in Fairyland, ma?"  
said Polly, gayly; "the whole of 'em, Phronsie!  
"You're sure you've got the right check?"  
"Why, yes," laughed the boy; "why not?"  
you're too young," put in Percy.  
"Aren't you glad I've come, Polly?"  
"Weren't you awfully surprised?"  
"Father knew how to do it."  
"So her mother was willing?"  
"Look at her now, Polly, quick!"  
"Yes," said Polly, "isn't she sweet!"  
"Come on, Polly, we must go."  
"Where are we going, Polly?"  
"Why," said Polly, "how could I!  
"She went to the Post Office!"  
"What is the matter, father?"  
"Can I have a great many?"  
"Let's all write," said Polly.  
said his mamma, soothingly.  
repeated Mrs. Whitney.  
of course the flowers can't come."  
"That's it; go on, Thomas!"  
"In three weeks from to-morrow," said Jasper.  
"You needn't go yet, Phronsie," said Polly.  
There she stopped perfectly still.  
he cried in excitement, "see!"  
"How did their faces look, Phronsie, dear?"  
Joel looked up steadily.  
Let's begin again, Van!"  
"Mamma wouldn't like it you know.  
Say, Joe, where do you s'pose Ben is?"  
I hope the snakes will bite him!"  
"Cause they're all stuffed--so there now!"  
"I don't believe it, Polly."  
She shall learn to draw--she shall!"  
"And then she'll be so s'prised, Polly!  
"Ben's going to teach us."  
said Jasper, "that is a class!  
That would be a nice corner!"  
"Don't begin till I get there."  
"You are having a nice time!  
I wish I could live in one!  
Then my head will feel better."  
said Phronsie, in a soft little voice.  
again asked Mrs. Pepper, wonderingly.  
Now Marian, not a word!"  
And, besides, you interrupt."  
"I must get this thing fixed up to-day.  
that was all Polly could say.  
"What's the matter with it?"  
"There now--there's a lot more.  
And she started for the door.  
"Oh, mamsie, will he die, do you think?"  
"Why, he does act queer, don't he?  
P'raps he's been eating too much?"  
"Oh, dear me, mamsie, what shall I do!"  
"My bundle," began Polly.  
No need to ask for it now!  
repeated Mr. Whitney, perplexedly.  
"No, I shall--I heard her first!"  
"I like Polly best, I do!"  
asked Joel, interrupting.  
said Polly, with a long sigh.  
"I'll tell you how we'll fix it!  
they both cried in great distress.

"Well, boys, ready for the road?  
There was a moment's pause.  
Why don't you whip the beast up?"  
"Mind what you're up to in them 'saminations."  
"We'd better ask at this door."  
I say, can't you remember?"  
I vote we don't wait for him."  
Now then, Joe, give her her head.  
Just a little horse-play, that's all."  
Heathcote and Coote became grave.  
"Let go, while I'm driving.  
there comes something on the road!  
Look at the smash she's made."  
"Good-bye, and thanks awfully."  
"What shall we say to Ashford?"  
"The middle for me," said Coote.  
We're sorry to be late, sir."  
"Leave my sight, sir, instantly!  
"Now please go when I tell you."  
Give me a kiss, my dear boy."  
"It's double his right fare.  
"No--I live in Devonshire."  
"What school were you at before?"  
Dick did receive it kindly.  
he demanded presently.  
"I'm afraid," he faltered.  
"Don't be a young ass," said Dick.  
"I suppose I can't help it.  
He didn't count them, that was plain.  
"Tell him I'm up, will you?"  
"I hope there is," said Heathcote.  
"Take off your coats and waistcoats," said he.  
And the knowing ones were right.  
"It does," said the two elders.  
"He'd be a brick if he did."  
He'll be here in the morning.  
"It's a regular joke.  
A snail's nothing to him."  
Dick looked a little concerned.  
"Hadn't you better come with me?"  
Glad you've come to Templeton."  
"You'll know to-morrow, most likely," said he.  
You've got to apologise."  
"Why, it's only half-past seven?"  
"How is it you're not in bed?  
"Why didn't you ask the matron?  
he said in a deep whisper.  
Aspinall had seen a ghost!  
Where ever did you get to?"  
Are you coming, too, Heathcote?"  
"Why, you can't swim once across!"  
The seniors were delighted.  
Gosse looked uncomfortable.  
"Now then, once across and back.  
"I suppose I do," said he, sulkily.  
"Right you are, most learned Plato!  
"Are all the Sixth monitors?"  
"Yes, what do you want with him?"  
He was awfully obliged."  
And did he give you the whip?"  
"No, he hadn't got it handy.  
A GENERAL ELECTION.  
"Why, everybody, of course.  
"Shall I put you up, old man?  
There's a lot of business.  
(Cries of 'We'll back you up,' and cheers.)  
"No, but I'm not surprised.  
asked Pontifex, looking hard at his man.  
"No offence, old man," said the captain.  
demanded that official.  
I suppose you've not got one."  
"Hallo," he said, "you won't find much left."  
Get next to me at chapel."  
"I dare say not," said Heathcote.  
"Tremendously," said Cartwright.  
Suspect everything he does.  
Be warned in time.--Junius."  
"Suspect everything he does."  
"Do you think Cresswell wrote it?  
"The Templeton ghost, my boy."  
Forbes got one early last term."  
"What had Heathcote better do?"  
He'd better read the letter.  
"Yes; have you seen the letter?"  
And you believe it, of course?"  
I hardly ever saw him."  
I could keep no hold of him.  
You're not going to frame it?"  
"Ah, Troup, old man," and such-like greetings.  
How do you do, Aspinall?  
He strokes down everybody.  
"It's coming on, my boy.  
"Why don't you show enough wipe?  
How's the novel, my boy?"  
Hold out your hand, you young muff."  
In vain he tried to get free.  
once more asked the president.  
"Steady," says Birket; "don't be too sure."  
You're not a Tom Sayers yet."  
I've come to see about that."  
"Please, Birket, I've been licked already."  
"Did he tell you so himself?"  
"He is one of the elect.  
"How should we get over, though?"  
"Oh, I know some of the Fourth.  
"Is there any one inside?"  
Chivalry is infectious.  
"We'll sit close, you know," said Dick.  
They could have gone on all night.  
"But, Dick, they're all monitors!"  
Ponty rambled out among the last.  
What a crow if we do, eh?"  
Which road goes to Templeton?"  
The mercy was dearly bought.  
Blessed if I ever see you afore."  
"Jolly good job," said Heathcote.  
"It's bound to lead somewhere."  
and I'll back you up, old man.  
"Oh, you have turned up, have you?"  
"I don't mean to fret myself."  
"Dick," he said, "it's all out!  
Police Station, Templeton."  
We didn't steal the boat, did we?"  
That was downright robbery."  
Tom looked up and scanned the group.  
"I wouldn't mind if he was on."  
"Well, there are two vacancies.  
But we might try when you're in.  
But where were Dick and Heathcote?  
"Which two of you are the best?"  
"One--six" was the score in games.  
Dick was not superstitious.  
They'll teach you to be a cad.  
Who'll teach me to be a cad?  
Is Cresswell in his study?"  
The hero's face brightened.  
that's what you think, is it?"  
Who's leading him astray?  
"Perhaps I'm wrong," said he.  
This was just what Dick wanted.  
who are you calling an ass?"  
Saint George propose to break rules?  
"What book am I to ask for?"  
said Heathcote, giving it up.  
"Shut up and don't be a fool!"  
"Don't be too sure, old man," said Ponty.  
"Go easy with them at first.  
Give the little chaps a chance."  
"We've both made a mess of it."  
"You mean Pledge did them for you.  
asked Dick of Swinstead, who sat in front.  
"Do you mean he will fight me?"  
Look alive, or he'll catch you."  
'Not if I know it, sir,' she said."  
"I don't know his name," said Coote.  
I'm very sorry, sir."  
"The pawnbroker, I suppose," said Heathcote.  
What did Dick mean by "Don't know"?  
"Yes," said the cunning Georgie.  
"What's Dick going to do?"  
asked almost everybody.  
"I've got no racket," said Dick.  
What do you want to know for?"  
Perhaps you don't think so, though.  
It put things in a new light.  
In due time Cresswell returned.  
asked Dick, rather nervously.  
"What time does the tide turn, Joe?"  
They had a glorious day.  
"There's a big bite this time!"  
"What's the matter, youngster?"  
It seemed a long time coming.  
"Well, did the boats all come in?"  
It was getting serious.  
I know where we can get up.  
"Bless you, no one's about to-day.  
"What a pity Dick isn't here!"  
"Perhaps somebody would hear.  
Hadn't we better chuck a stone."  
I'm going to thrash you."  
He was not a bit surprised.  
"So it's a row, is it?"  
"He cuts me dead," said Heathcote.  
"I don't break my heart at all!"  
said Heathcote, miserably.  
So was Aspinall, wasn't he?  
"If he wants you, let him come.  
I want that pencil- case, there!"  
"Really, I never took it!  
You may feel in my pockets.  
"I suppose you haven't, really?"  
What's he going to do?"  
asked Coote, "if I hadn't got it.  
He could see no way through it.  
"I've got ten shillings," said Dick.  
But--I don't see how he can."  
"So do I, rather, old man."  
And they went off arm-in-arm to find him.  
"I've got ten bob," said Georgie.  
"He's sure he's not both?"  
"I'm positive," said Coote.  
What do you think it was worth?"  
"And yet you never saw it."  
I suppose you'll make that do?"  
Suppose I do it for you?"  
"No, I'm not," said Georgie.  
"Well, Webster, anything new?"  
The fact is, sir, I've been robbed."  
You'd better leave it to me."  
"Well, don't be in a hurry.  
"Because I was the fellow."  
exclaimed the Hermit, aghast.  
It was a great loss to us.  
wonderful elocution!"  
"Ah, it is good to be here.  
Do you want me to fight him?"  
He didn't like the look of things.  
(Cheers, not unmixed with blushes.)  
"Why, it's half-past eight," said Heathcote.  
WHICH TREATS OF LAW AND JUSTICE.  
"I said nothing of the sort.  
"Quite a delicious surprise.  
"Really, hadn't you better ask Swinstead?  
He's your protector now.  
"Then I'll answer it for you.  
Should he appeal to Winter?  
There was nothing else to do.  
"I don't think he did steal it.  
said the clerk, shuffling his notes.  
By that time the tide was in.  
demanded the clerk of Tom.  
"Bless you, sir, likely as not.  
Suppose we do without it.  
(_e_) Swum round the Black Buoy.  
(Laughter, and 'hear, hear,' from Cartwright.)  
not one of their names was there!  
Of course, we'll go and run through!"  
"They sometimes run a twelve-miler," said he.  
"No, thank you," said the Hermit.  
"They don't know what they're in for."  
asked the whipper-in, taking out his watch.  
"We're out of it," said Georgie, despondently.  
So they held on gallantly.  
They've doubled on their own scent.  
"We--that is I--let it go."  
"Yes, every step," gasped Dick.  
We're in a   regular row.  
I hope they won't transport us.  
You have just time to catch it.  
"From G.  Richardson, London.  
Let's all go and meet him."  
The narration did him good.  
"About the trial, father?"  
But he was not so minded.  
"We're not," stammered Georgie, very red.  
It was just what Pledge wanted.  
"Oh, yes, I'll try," said Georgie.  
"I can't fancy how he heard.  
"It's all a lie, Georgie.  
My father would shut him up.  
"But suppose I've promised him?"  
We must cheek it, that's all.  
I wish mother could come too."  
"Let's hear their names," said Dick.  
"All right," said the obliging scrutineer.  
"Another dead-heat, I expect," said Pauncefote.  
Don't forget his trot with the Harriers!"  
"Then Coote is in," announced the scrutineers.  
I don't believe in hole-and-corner business.  
The "Firm" started suddenly.  
When Pledge had ceased, he exclaimed--  "Pencil-case!  
He'd nothing to do with it.  
"You offered to get it back.  
"Is that all you want to say?"  
said Mansfield, turning to Pledge.  
"Thank you, gentlemen," said the tradesman.  
"Yes, we did," shouted the "chaps."  
However, I don't complain.  
What I want to say is this.  
So had I; _so_ had Cresswell.  
He may not be popular.  
said the Hermit in a sepulchral tone.  
"Yes, my boy; but keep it mum.

Letters from the General.  
Gundi carried by the Bayonet.  
We will drive over at once.  
"No," Captain Ripon said, quietly.  
He lives half a mile away.  
"He is a good husband, sir."  
"Oh, nonsense, my good woman!  
his wife retorted, laughing.  
"Where is that little pickle?"  
Nowhere was Tom to be seen.  
Nurse, have you seen Master Tom?  
"Why, how long have you missed him?"  
Then he started, as if struck.  
Yes, he remembered it now.  
On such a night as this, too.  
There was no one else in sight.  
"You are right, for once," he said.  
"Don't cry, dear," the woman said.  
"If she wake, she beat Billy."  
He really does you credit.  
"Here we are," Sam Dickson said.  
"Now, stop quietly outside.  
"You, Gale, will stop on the smack.  
The boy was soon hard at work.  
"The same kind of fish as this?"  
"I suppose you don't swear, Will.  
"The boy's sure to do it.  
"It might be, or it might not.  
I and my girls are members."  
"I wish they were all on board.  
The boat was soon alongside.  
The wind increased to a gale.  
Such a chance did not occur.  
"I don't like this, Hans," Will said.  
"That was a near squeak," Will said.  
Then they went back to the shore.  
A keel was laid, 25 feet in length.  
The lads sat down on the shore.  
It's a chance, anyhow.  
Will shouted as they neared her.  
"Take the helm at once, my lad.  
"I do not know," Will replied.  
"I do not know, sir," Will said.  
"Now, quick, lads, into the boat.  
"But where did the boy spring from?  
The place of assembly was Kohat.  
an officer said, close by.  
The third leveled and fired.  
The gorge was five miles in length.  
"I will wait with you," Will said.  
Chapter 12: The Advance Up The Khyber.  
Winter was now close at hand.  
Sheer-Ali was not wholly to be blamed.  
Chapter 13: The Massacre At Cabul.  
"Yes, it is peace," the boy said.  
But Will had no eyes for him.  
"Trouble is coming," he said.  
Yossouf became daily more anxious.  
"He has been sent here by the commander-in-chief.  
"He will not leave his white friend."  
Mr. Jenkyns had fallen outside.  
Chapter 14: The Advance Upon Cabul.  
"Has the mission been captured?"  
Shafto was, unfortunately, killed.  
Winter was fast setting in.  
One of these was William Gale.  
Chapter 16: The Fight In The Pass.  
A panic seized the Afghans.  
The time passed quietly, now.  
"And now, there is one thing more.  
The Guides were on the alert.  
"We must try and clear them out.  
We cannot stop here all night.  
They are attacked front and rear.  
The men looked at each other.  
Will now told them what Yossouf had said.  
Your man, Yossouf, has a revolver."  
There are seven women here.  
"How many are there of you?"  
"Seven," the woman answered.  
"Now, lads, dismount and clear the village.  
But it was of no avail.  
Everything was abandoned.  
You remember her, Shepherd?  
What is the matter with you?"  
"But how on earth can that be?"  
Is your head quite clear, old friend?"  
That is his step on the stairs.  
There is no more to be told.

"Dreaming, John, as usual?  
I never saw such a boy.  
I was looking at the lake."  
"Active, certainly, Mary!  
"You need not do that, Mary.  
"All Galilee is with him.  
We are faithful to his law."  
"And it is the same, elsewhere.  
"In His hand is all power.  
"He can save us, if He will.  
I will see to her, myself."  
"Where do you belong, my lad?"  
But what am I to do, now?  
"I am just going to land.  
"I say as you do, Simon.  
"A nice milksop he would have thought me!"  
Thirteen thousand perished here.  
he asked, after a long pause.  
It is but thirty furlongs distant."  
Samaria stands neutral.  
"They can never take it," Joab said, scornfully.  
"What has been done in the south?  
"I know not," John said, simply.  
Jotapata may save Jerusalem, yet."  
"Yes, he is here," the boy said.  
"No doubt it would," John agreed.  
But they were not inactive.  
"Well, come along with me, then.  
"I can get about, I can.  
He may find it of great use."  
He was pierced by five arrows.  
All that night, the contest raged unceasingly.  
Few cared how soon the end came.  
This was Antoninus, a centurion.  
The next day passed like the first.  
"And yet, they talk of Roman magnanimity!  
"Now we can start," the boy said.  
"Not so, my son," Martha said.  
Tiberias was, in fact, his chief city.  
Chapter 8: Among The Mountains.  
These were not long in coming.  
I have been here ten minutes.  
In the meantime, Itabyrium had fallen.  
"But it seems absurd, mother.  
"You and Jonas can escape."  
No, we will keep together."  
We have harmed no one, my lord."  
Jonas was close beside him.  
"That will be enough, Jonas.  
I can draw my hand through, now."  
Once on the hill, you are safe.  
John had now time to look round.  
"Well, Jonas, what is your news?"  
Did you know he was with you?"  
"Yes, I knew he was," John said.  
"And now, let us be going.  
You cannot mean it, Simon!"  
So I did not withstand him.  
"Come, Mary, let us to bed!"  
"Are you ill this morning, child?"  
"I am so unhappy, John."  
What nonsense you are talking!  
Simon was the first to speak.  
He understood her question.  
"They have no wills of their own.  
Placidus overtook and attacked them.  
John's knife fell from his hand.  
"Ah, here come Plancus and the others!  
John exclaimed, indignantly.  
"It is better so," John said.  
one of them asked, presently.  
"For two reasons," John replied.  
I blame not those who have gone.  
Simon still hesitated.  
Then he turned again to John.  
His face was leonine in expression.  
The scene was calm and peaceful.  
One fell, pierced with numerous javelins.  
Chapter 15: The Siege Is Begun.  
For some time the battle raged.  
For once, John of Gischala kept his word.  
"Mine are all picked men," John said.  
He has offered to spare it.  
"And how long could we hold out?"  
Simon said, with a hard laugh.  
Some stabbed themselves with their swords.  
"We must not grumble at fate.  
"Are you weary of life, Jew?  
He will tell you about it."  
"And now, why all these questions?"  
"So that was John of Gamala, himself!"  
I made sure that you were dead.  
Would you serve in the army?  
"I do, indeed," John replied.  
"What shall we do with the chest?"  
"They are well, I hope, Isaac?"  
The matter was beyond him.  
"What has detained you, Isaac?"  
"Yes, I saw him in Egypt."  
In a moment she was gone.  
"What is this you have brought home?"  
"What think you, little Mary?  
Jonas never left his friend.

Harry rose as he entered.

"What had we best do, Jacob?"  
the captain of the brig said.  
This order was carried out.  
Having done this, they looked round.  
Then all was silent again.  
methinks I do also," the prince said.  
"We must die, my lad," he said.  
The pursuit was a short one.  
Another two hours passed.  
THE DEFENSE OF AN OUTPOST.  
Let us ride to his rescue."  
"You must have known it," he said.  
What have you to say to this?  
The enemy saw him too.  
So they started for the north.  
That is the enemy's footmen.  
The hours passed wearily.  
Montrose had been defeated.  
But think it over, my son.  
His two friends closed in by him.  
A RIOT IN THE CITY.  
"I am ready," the king said.  
"Providence is against me.  
"It is all over," he said.  
On the 27th sentence was pronounced.  
But come with me you shall not."  
For hours he struggled on.  
Harry put it to his lips.  
Harry felt far from easy.  
The lad at once left the hut.  
My servant was more thoughtful.  
"What can I do for the boy?"  
"I thought so," Mr. Blake laughed.  
"You haven't got rid of him yet.  
"It is not your fault, master.  
"Is your name Master Furness?"  
This was the bed of the slaves.  
he exclaimed furiously.  
The planter hesitated.  
"You have brought some troops with you?"  
he asked, "They will be wanted."  
The Royalists, with shouts of "Remember Drogheda!"  
I cannot say as much now.  
"Well, sir, and what if I did?"  
"But it is a bad business.  
Harry, however, was firm.  
In a moment the swords met.  
"Here come the horse," Jacob said.  
and the Scottish horse swept down.  
I will cover the retreat.  
THE PATH ACROSS THE MORASS.  
In vain they struggled forward.  
is ever King of England.  
"But have they changed her name, then?"  
"Please let me pass," he panted.  
"Loose him," the general said.  
Come, Long, let us be stirring.  
Mike gave a cry of despair.  
Leslie looked at William Long.  
Get us a stout sailing boat.  
Its aspect was threatening.  
Leslie went up to the group.  
I think we must be in time."  
"I think so," William Long said.  
Their arms were bound to their sides.  
The winter passed quietly.  
Nine years of wars and troubles!  
No wonder men are aweary of it.  
It suits not your condition.  
"I might do that," Harry said.  
In a minute swords were drawn.  
Here a dim light was burning.  
Harry did not hesitate.  
Harry did as directed.  
"I am safe here," she answered.  
"Could you go and tell the watch?"  
Will you accept this token?"  
"You cannot leave now," she said.  
"That will do," the captain said.  
Fletcher will drive you himself."  
"I must see him," Harry urged.  
"It is useless," the man said.  
"I would see him in person."  
"You are bold, sir," Cromwell said.  
"I doubt you not," Cromwell said.  
England needs honest men here.  
You will hear further from me to-morrow."  
"And who is the _we_, father?"  
She was still singing at the drinking-house.

ON FURTHER EVENTS ON THE ALP                           268   XXII.  
"Where are you taking the child, Deta?"  
asked Barbara eagerly.  
Thus they strayed from side to side.  
How late you are already!"  
"You'll have to look out for that!"  
Deta did not have to be told twice.  
Nothing could be seen inside.  
Heidi stood still to listen.  
"What do you want to do now?"  
The child obeyed the command.  
This the grandfather opened.  
"Are they ours, grandfather?  
Do they both belong to us?  
"Here," it sounded from somewhere.  
How wonderful that must be!  
Peter commanded again.  
That would hurt you horribly."  
everything is on fire.  
Oh, look at the fir-trees over there!"  
Oh, now they are getting grey.  
"Come now, we have to go home."  
Heidi exclaimed in her fright.  
She asked how it came about.  
"The sun does it," he exclaimed.  
Come and join us at supper."  
Your hands are as warm as toast!  
"How quickly the time has flown.  
"Just the same," the boy replied.  
We can do it tomorrow."  
We can do it tomorrow!"  
The hut is tumbling down!"  
Surely that is a hammer.  
"Do you think there is no way?"  
But come now, where are your things?"  
"I won't come," Heidi replied.  
Deta repeated her wish again.  
Miss Rottenmeier exclaimed indignantly.  
"But how did you learn to read?"  
"Miss Deta, how could you bring this child?"  
"Why don't you give it to me?"  
"Miss Rottenmeier told me to call you Miss."  
Did anybody send you?"  
"How can I take them with me?"  
"But to whom shall I send them?  
Do you belong to Mr.  
After that she went away.  
Miss Clara never goes out.  
With those words she left the room.  
You look like a vagabond!"  
What will poor Snowhopper do without me?  
"Bring the unlucky child up!"  
Heidi walked up-stairs very slowly.  
They are running round like wild!"  
Oh, they were for grandmother!"  
You don't fight together, what?"  
Here is your friend back again.  
Did you get nice fresh water?"  
I want to know," said Mrs. Sesemann.  
Stand up now and look at me!  
Now we are merry again!"  
Now we'll be merry again."  
What have you learnt, child, tell me?"  
"What is it that you can't learn?"  
"Well, what kind of boy is he?  
What is making you so sad?"  
Can't you tell Clara perhaps?"  
Do you understand me, child?  
Don't you pray every night?  
"Have you never prayed, Heidi?  
"That is not the way, Heidi.  
Clara assented, and Heidi began.  
asked the doctor, much amused.  
So they talked till one o'clock.  
Mr. Sesemann seized his revolver.  
"You are not afraid, I hope?"  
said the doctor, getting up.  
The doctor came forward now.  
"Sesemann, this case belongs to my field.  
--But Heidi could say no more.  
We shall have to act quickly.  
and the carriage rolled away.  
"Then why are you coming back?"  
"Because Mr. Sesemann let me come."  
"Is it really you, Heidi?  
Have you really come again?"  
Soon he was ready to start.  
she added after a pause.  
"Oh yes, I wish you would, child.  
"What shall I read, grandmother?"  
Thank you, God bless you for it."  
"I wish your mother was here.  
Just think of my lonely home!"  
Good-morning, grandfather," Heidi exclaimed.  
"Are your eyes bright already?"  
I must be home when they come."  
the doctor asked, with a smile.  
Now we'll go to grandfather."  
Come and look what is in it."  
asked Peter as usual.  
Wouldn't that make us doubly sad?  
Can you understand me, child?"  
said the friendly gentleman.  
But they had been full of tears.  
Where are you going to sleep?"  
Peter can hardly get through.  
No bed ought to be like that."  
I also have you, my child!  
Please finish the song, will you?"  
"Safely homeward may return!"  
"I have done it already."  
"What is the matter with you?"  
asked his mother, eagerly.  
Did you hear it, grandmother?"  
How did this happen, Peter?"  
Who has brought about this change?"  
Who would have ever thought it!  
Oh grandmama, I wish I could stay here!"  
"Oh, what wonderful flowers!"  
It was time for dinner now.  
I have never seen its like!  
What a delicious perfume!  
"What a lovely place to sleep!  
I'll undertake it gladly."  
And now I am so hungry!"  
she asked, holding out the bowl.  
"The uncle said so himself."  
You have red, round cheeks, my child!  
What have we to thank you for!  
You have become broad and round!  
Have you sent the men away?"  
When would he reach the goat-herd's hut?  
"Good, here's another one!"  
Clara called with beaming eyes.  
Is it really you, Clara?"  
she exclaimed, clapping her hands.  
Stop trembling and listen.  
Now your punishment is near!'  
Peter nodded, all contrite.  
"Now I'll explain this to you.  
"And may it be God's will!"  
We shall never forget you!"  
With that, Mrs. Sesemann shook her hand.  
"You can send her salt, Clara.

I would

That relieved me a great deal.  
He handed me a blue pill.

They went away thoughtfully.  
I couldn't see much difference.  
I didn't like the battery.

"Now hand out  
that other lot."  
O, God, when will this all  
     end.  
"Thank God," said the general.  
I told him he was correct.  
Then he went  
into details.  
"Prithe nothing," said the corporal.  
"What you got in that bustle?"

you touch me I shall scream.  
asked the colonel of my black-eyed

I told him I was all

And I offered him _bacon_.

"What are you talking about?"  
I was about

I said to him, "Six mule team?"  
"Are the niggers to be killed?"  
"Well, sah," said he with dignity.  
The animals are  
branded 'U.

No; well, I am very glad.

"Well, they won't eat him, my dear.  
That's it, isn't it, Harry?"  
It comes to them, I suppose."  
"I don't know, sir," the boy said doubtfully.  
"At anyrate we will sleep upon it.  
I should like that immensely."  
"Yes, sir, it would be first rate!"  
There was nothing more to say.  
and Harry felt they were friends.  
Of Paris he saw little.  
The girls would give me no peace.  
They slept twice upon the road.  
"Not a bit, sir," Harry said.  
"There was nothing in that, sir.  
I have seen the king and queen.  
"For months he is not heard of.  
"Are you hurt, my dear Ernest?"  
There is a triumph for us."  
He put his horn to his lips.  
But the marquis had no fears.  
No one is opposing them.  
What on earth can they want more?  
"Impossible, Edouard!"  
Harry was glad at the change.  
"But the children, Edouard!"  
The people are mad so far.  
Then for a moment he paused.  
"Is it you, mademoiselle?"  
she exclaimed in great surprise.  
"And you, my little angel?  
"You do not recognize me!"  
I do not know what to do.  
Harry gave him his address.  
"You are a dear boy, Harry!"  
"Oh, it is you, friend Harry!  
was the count's first question.  
Harry exclaimed in surprise.  
Yes, that might be possible.  
"I don't know, mademoiselle.  
Nothing suspicious, I hope?  
But how is it to be done?"  
He is simply venomous.  
"Yes, in that house opposite.  
And now here we are close home.  
Well, what is your idea?"  
That would give me time to bolt.  
The mob will not follow you.  
You can do nothing yourself.  
What is going to take place?  
"This is horrible, Henri!"  
"Thank you greatly," Harry said.  
"I will take him to my room.  
"It was rash of you, young sir.  
We have plenty of money.  
"You speak like a man of heart.  
"Thank you very much," he said.  
Three or four were spared at the Abbaye.  
They brought them out together.  
They are wretches, the aristocrats.  
"God only can console them.  
I will come in this evening.  
"Come in," she said, "and sit down.  
"I trust so indeed, Louise.  
We must think of the future.  
"Citizen Lebat," he corrected.  
one of the bystanders asked.  
"What are you doing, Harry?  
"There is something wrong, Harry.  
"I feel better now," she said.  
Are we to go home, Harry?  
It is awful to think of.  
Harry exclaimed in surprise.  
Have you thought of anything?"  
Still we mustn't be disheartened.  
It isn't that she doesn't feel it.  
Do you think it can be done?"  
Once he had said, "Where am I?"  
What do you think I did, Jeanne?  
I live but two streets away.  
"I am a poor man, you know.  
You bring us some news, don't you?"  
"You are not joking, Harry?"  
"I think he may refuse, Jeanne.  
Sentence of death was pronounced.  
She thinks Victor is safe there.  
So the crisis had arrived.  
"Oh, I remember now," Lebat said.  
I shall be on the look-out for you.  
Where am I to drive you to?"  
Lebat jumped out and rang at the bell.  
Harry at once checked the horse.  
He will be no more trouble."  
"Here are the empty houses.  
I will get rid of this trash."  
Harry, however, got out.  
You will be safe here, my child.  
Jeanne exclaimed as he entered.  
"A sure, certain way, Harry?"  
"Have you told us all, Harry?"  
I did not tell her last night.  
"Oh, Harry, how good you are!  
How much you have done for us!"  
"Time is nothing," Marie said.  
I have wanted you so much."  
The only thing is about to-night.  
Robespierre nodded and held out his hand.  
It is all simple enough.  
"You must not say so, Harry.  
"I can see it in your face.  
Why don't you trust me, Harry?  
I can see it by his face.  
I think he is a good man.  
I tell you I shall watch him.  
"Have you told me all, Harry?"  
"Yes, that will be the best plan."  
"Thank you all for your warning.  
I need not lose all hope yet.  
We have committed no crime.'  
Now, how are they to be saved?"  
"I cannot say, monsieur," Adolphe said hesitatingly.  
"Could you not embark in a lugger?"  
"Why not start in a lugger at once?  
"A hatch might do," Pierre said.  
Four inches would be enough.  
The hatches are covered with tarpaulin.  
And now good-bye, my good friends!  
But I will do it, monsieur.  
"Still I have just one hope left.  
When does your lugger sail for England?"  
Then Harry said:  "That is all, Adolphe."  
Now, a wrench all together."  
"I am sure of the eldest.  
They have got the hatch off there.  
It was long before he woke.  
she exclaimed as he finished.  
"What are we to do, Harry?"  
We are affianced now, dear, come what will."  
"That is right, mademoiselle.  
"I can understand, monsieur.  
After great trouble great joy.  
Why have you not thought of it?  
"It never entered my mind.  
"Are you all right down there, Jeanne?"  
It sounds like a miracle."  
"There is nothing to be done to-night.  
At last they got to the top.  
"How thoughtful you are, Harry!"  
"Where are father and mother?"  
"I was sure there was," she said.

The windows were all open.  
what is the matter, colonel?"  
Look after your regiment."  
what were the white troops up to?  
In ten minutes he returned.  
"Splendid, Dick; why should we not?  
Now for your revolver, Dick!  
It's well it's no worse."  
"How much are they gaining, Rose?"  
In ten minutes he came back.  
Now let us go on again!"  
Then they came upon the road.  
it is aching terribly.  
Dick, you had better stay here."  
Where are the English ladies?"  
"How are we to carry Rose?  
I will hide them here safely.  
In an hour the Hindoo returned.  
Their pistols were a trouble.  
They then entered it boldly.  
he said, in deep gratitude.  
"There is no help for it, Dick.  
The major opened his eyes.  
he asked Ned, as their path crossed.  
There was no time to talk then.  
"How far is it to Delhi?  
We heard the guns there just now."  
There we are, fairly alight.  
"Of course we've got to risk it.  
"Dick, you follow; take good aim."  
Death to the infidel dogs!"  
A DASHING EXPEDITION.  
Very slowly passed the day.  
You have much to go through yet."  
"How is the one who was ill?"  
"Do you think they are still at Nahdoor?  
"Thank God for that," Major Warrener said.  
Their captain rode up to me.  
'Are there any Feringhees hid here, old man?'  
he said; 'I had forgotten you!'  
Then a rope must be lowered.  
"Have the women here been kind?"  
We don't want the horses hurt."  
"Thank God, it is all over!"  
the officer on guard said.  
"May Heaven bless you, lady!"  
Now tell us how you got here."  
"We dare not leave you here," Ahrab said.  
"I have much news to tell you.  
The fighting is over here.  
"Why, Dunlop, don't you know us?"  
"Do we halt here for the day?"  
Besides these he had Warrener's Horse.  
"We are certain to do so.  
But this is not the worst part.  
"And how are we to get there?"  
Well, we must do our best.  
Dick asked in astonishment.  
THE BESIEGED RESIDENCY.  
"Are our losses heavy?"  
have you got an idea?"  
Edith exclaimed in surprise.  
There they joined Mr. Johnson.  
We must act on it at once.  
"Break open a barrel, quick!"  
"Now fill your cap with powder."  
All your thanks are due to them."  
None could give an opinion.  
"We know the officer, Dick.  
Where on earth have you come from?  
Thenceforth the besiegers worked night and day.  
On the 15th the stubborn fighting recommenced.  
"Oh, I can mount you," he said.  
"This is where old Delhi stood.  
Is it not magnificent?"  
They listened attentively.  
I didn't think of their firing."  
"What is going on outside?"  
"What's best to be done, Ned?"  
Do you think that the best plan?"  
Lend a hand to help these poor wretches.  
"Very well," Captain Peel said.  
The girl flushed up rosy red.  
"Stoop low, for heaven's sake!"  
Nelly held hers out to him.  
"Oh, how stupid you are, Dick!"  
Not a scratch either of us."  
We part just on these terms, Dick.  
Do you agree to that, Dick?"  
Now what do you want it for?  
This black bag is full of it."  
"My dear boys, the prize is yours."  
exclaimed the boys together.  
"Let us sell our lives here!"  
"Excellent," the colonel said.  
He's hit in the shoulder."  
Are you in much pain, old boy?"  
You may as well say good-by to him.  
Something must be done at once.  
Send some water up at once."  
How is he to be got down?"

The horse had passed like a shot.  
"He's a very nice one."  
"Yes aunt," said Jackanapes, thinking of the hobby-horses.  
"And how did ye spend it--_sir_?"  
inquired the General.  
Trumpet for myself, twopence, that's fivepence.  
Skittles, a penny, one and ninepence.  
"So you do, sir, so you do!"  
Glad you mentioned it, grandson.  
"You were born to the saddle.  
"Whom are you talking about?"  
Left lung--"  "Will he recover?"  
The Major wheeled and left him.

"I don't know, sir," Jack answered.  
You are to go home at once."  
Is any one ill at home?"  
I wonder what it can mean."  
"Sit down, Jack," his father said.  
This he had, of course, obtained.  
"This is glorious," he said.  
You need not come on board, Jack.  
I expect he would let them.  
I vote we go for a ride.  
What on earth's to be done?"  
I don't think that can be right.  
"What on earth shall we do, Jack?  
Hawtry said, advancing to the men.  
"I fancy it's kid," Hawtry said.  
Presently Jack spoke again.  
"Well," Hawtry said, "that's clear enough.  
They had no fear of pursuit.  
It's our only chance."  
Some were cut down as they stood.  
"All the better," Mr. Hethcote said.  
I hear that his lungs were pierced.  
"Who shall I take with me, sir?"  
Cutlasses were sharpened and pistols cleaned.  
Now, retire at the double."  
"Jump on board, lads, jump on board!"  
"Thank God we are out of that!"  
"Have you many hurt, Mr.  
Mr. Hethcote asked in a moment.  
Are you hit yourself, Mr.  
A nice night we are in for!"  
But not for the whole army.  
The fire commenced at half-past six.  
You're off duty, are you not?  
"I must go back again, Jack."  
roared the indignant chorus.  
What's all this noise about?"  
"It's cheerful to hear you.  
"Get up, gentlemen, get up.  
"That's the headquarter staff."  
Just lie down behind the crest.  
By Jove, they're only just in time.  
There are the Guards falling back.  
"Now," Dick said, "I will go down."  
"Stop lowering if we yell."  
How many are there alive?"  
"Not for some little time, Jack.  
The duties were not severe.  
"That's no great odds," Jack said.  
This is something like comfort.  
This was almost beyond Dick.  
"No, I suppose not," he said.  
Olga said, clapping her hands.  
Papa is so good and kind!  
I never heard such a shame."  
The countess looked anxious and careworn.  
"Five hundred roubles and your freedom."  
"But when am I to be paid?"  
the horseman said angrily.  
"By no means, your Excellency.  
They will have their instructions.  
"May God pardon the sinner!"  
"Who has signed that document?"  
He seems to me to be dead.  
The young ladies were very Niobes.  
Do you hear the bells tolling?  
The man carried a lantern.  
Go straight on to the chateau.  
There was a hasty parting.  
"Good-day, comrades," he said in Polish.  
"So are you on your way home?  
"The dawn will soon be at hand.  
I could scarce understand you."  
We expect to find friends there.  
"Certainly we do," Jack said.  
It may be useful to you.  
"Wait till I have read this through."  
The Poles were in high spirits.  
The effect was tremendous.  
The woods were full of dense smoke.  
Of the Poles some 250 had been put _hors-de-combat_.  
You are now in his palace.  
"Oh, no," the lady exclaimed.  
There are only ten wounded.  
"You must be starving," she said.  
Now, it is just nine o'clock.  
"It is at the door," she said.  
"Keep steady, Jack," Dick whispered.  
Never mind, let us push on."  
Mr. Hethcote exclaimed, astonished.  
In front of the Traktia Bridge was a breastwork.  
This was readily granted.  
"I'm awfully sorry!"  
One knows what it was last time.  
This they did with but slight loss.  
There was nothing to be done.  
The winter was very dull.  
The count looked keenly at him.

A LITTLE KNIGHT OF LABOR.  
how she had liked to do it!  
"What am I going to do?"  
Everything was in order.  
Come in and take your things off."  
"Shall I ever be like this?"  
It's not customary."  
responded Georgie, sadly.  
Have Mrs. St. John and Mrs.  
I don't quite know where he is.  
"I don't think so, Cousin Vi.  
Mr. St. John is in New York.  
"If life could all be like that!"  
Don't you see that I am right?"  
You never could live on that!  
I could live on that nicely."  
"Now come and sit down," she said.  
She consulted Miss Sally.  
So I was thinking of you.  
Bob Curtis looked bewildered.  
"What on earth does it all mean?"  
"Can you talk while you're working?"  
I'll be Grand Master's Mate."  
"But will you join the Union?"  
Older people were sorry.  
"Yes--only we must hurry."  
"Won't you come out and see him to-morrow, Nursey?"  
"Wouldn't it be fun if he could!  
How could a man like that walk?  
He felt lonely and forlorn.  
Alas, checkers are not for snow-men!  
It's as cold as a barn.  
The buttons were gone from his coat-tails.  
"It couldn't be anything else."  
"Mamma, mamma, where are you?  
"The how I must leave to you.  
Mary Vaughn cut out the case.  
Catherine made the _sachet_.  
WHO ATE THE QUEEN'S LUNCHEON?  
"It's good weather," replied Otillie.  
He looked tired and annoyed.  
So the thing is given up."  
"How can you talk in that way!"  
How dreadful it would have been!  
there was nothing to be seen!  
Davy dared not disobey.  
"Why, I can see their faces!"  
Aunt Patty had done her best.  
There was a pause as he ceased.  
Don't cry any more, my lad.  
No one else knew about it.  
A great wrong had been done her.  
Of course, I shall starve to death.  
"They needn't," she said to herself.  
"These great creatures are so queer!"  
I wish it would go away.  
Mamma looked so sweet and kind!  
"But they _are_ having a chance.  
"Oh, Will, don't tease," cried Milly irritably.  
Weariness sharpened her voice.  
I came up to look for you.  
Milly was forced to submit.  
"What a good time we _have_ had!"  
And it's quite true besides.  
Thus it went year after year.  
"No; it's your misfortune.  
"I _do_ wish you wouldn't dispute.  
What day of the month is it?"  
"Are we to stay here always?"  
said Mrs. Wendte, rubbing her hands.  
The stockings glowed with pleasure.  
This was promotion indeed.  
"And I'm for a real child.  
"Ah, little rogue that thou art!  
"I do not care for sugar.  
Only Greta went to church.  
"Why dost thou not eat it, dear?"  
He was shrewd as well as kind.  
What did your girl do with her sweetmeat?"  
What else should one do with a sweetmeat?"  
And now for your adventures.  
Did he eat it, or trade it?"  
What are you talking about?  
I don't call those worth having.  
My boy enjoyed his sweetmeat all day.  
ejaculated the White Pair, with amazement.  
The Little Blues said no more.  
"I think you are beautiful."  
All do not exercise it.  
Think a bit before you choose, Etelka.  
You needn't be afraid of _him_.  
Her thoughts flew to Sepperl of the Mill.  
"Very well," said Pertzal, "have thy wish."  
"I am sorry," she faltered.  
"Get thee in," she said harshly.  
he exclaimed, "the girl spoke true!  
Keep on till we are all rich."  
To-morrrow we will have some more of it."  
It was out of the question.  
What was the fool thinking of?  
But Etelka heard nothing of all this.  
Then he shook his head still more portentously.  
Marc did not stay with her long.  
Poor Etelka rejoiced to see him go.  
What queer creatures mortals be!"  
"Hast thou commerce with the elves?"  
"More than that," said the farmer.  
But it has fallen at last.  
Thou hast lost thy chance, Hilda."  
"The Lovers' Tree is blown down!  
There was a plenty to do.  
It isn't so any longer."  
She was certainly awake.  
Was this part of the vision?  
Yes, that was really her name!  
The farm was not productive.  
Everything seemed closing in.  
How long could she keep it up?  
"Doesn't it seem like a fortune?  
"I love this smell so," she said.  
I have let out the secret.  
These families were all large.  
So much better for the change!  
Eleanor was the girl at Ninety-three.  
The rooms were of the same size.  
"Besides, I don't want her to.  
"I do," replied Eleanor.  
You must let me help you now."  
"Oh, I didn't get anything.  
"You will laugh when I tell you.  
I'm going to begin to-morrow.  
But Eleanor could and did.  
With May it is different.  
THE SORROWS OF FELICIA.  
"Oh, children, do go away!"  
cried Felie in a despairing tone.  
I wish I knew Tennyson.  
"But not to all that I was.  
"Let's go down to the shut-up house.  
"What do you suppose it is?"  
Wouldn't it be fun if it was?  
"Don't cry so, Kitty," she said.  
We were naughty to come here.  
Forever and forever.  
Kitty, you are the lightest.

"Why does she dislike me so?"

Don't you go to Sunday school?"  
But Kate was not satisfied.

The man laughed at the question.

Maple, opening the door.

There's nae folk there--to call folk."  
I knocked again, and hearkened again.  
"It's loaded," said a voice.  
"They call me David Balfour."  
"And who do ye think I am?"  
"You know my father's name?"  
"Do ye ken what's in it?"  
"To give the letter," said I.  
"Your father's been long dead?"  
"A strange nature of a man!"  
Once it was, "And your mother?"  
He seemed grievously put out.  
"Na, na," said he, "I didnae mean that.  
I'll aff and see the session clerk."  
"Take your hand from my jacket.  
This is no way to behave."  
That's where the mistake is."  
"Well," he said, "let's begin."  
Out I went into the night.  
"Have you no fun about you?  
you should see them taking on.  
how he cried and carried on!  
I told him over again.  
"And what would he kill him for?"  
Here he is; here he shall bide."  
Hoseason turned upon him with a flash.  
"Well, sir, is not that enough?"  
Presently Mr. Riach came in.  
"We've only run a boat down."  
"No, sir; that I cannot do.  
Here's my hand upon it."  
"And so you're a Jacobite?"  
"Well," said he, "that can't be cured.  
"There's the skylight," said I.  
"That's him that killed the boy!"  
"And I've settled two," says he.  
"It was Shuan bauchled* it," I heard one say.  
O far-beholding eagles, Here is your meat."  
"I'll take the first watch," said he.  
They might speak at the window."  
And he smiled across at me.  
"Have I not passed my word, sir?  
"Well, sir," says Alan, "I am nae weathercock.  
"Could ye pilot us at all?"  
"And that's true," said Alan.  
"I call it noble," I cried.  
"Well, David, what does he do?  
Tell me your tale plainly out.  
And who are to succeed them?  
"Let me have a word," said I.  
asked the captain, gloomily.  
"Doubtless," said Alan, "but where?  
"Ye were right," said Hoseason to Alan.  
It seemed he was struck stupid.  
Then I had a flash of hope.  
I cried, and could not finish.  
Tell me what will bring it back?  
Is it more money you wish?"  
"What of the wind that bloweth where it listeth?"  
he added, smiling to me.  
"Putting his head in a bees' byke!"  
"The man that lives there," said I.  
"Take care of yourselves," says he.  
"Ten pounds if ye take that lad!"  
"Now," said he, "it's earnest.  
Do as I do, for your life."  
You and me must twine,"* I said.  
--by which he meant the fairies.  
"And do you know who did it?"  
"Blue or black, did ye know him?"  
Well, here I had taken mine.  
"As if this was your country!"  
"It's all Scotland," said I.  
"I'll chance it, Alan," said I.  
"He has some spunks of decency."  
"What's that the lassie has?"  
Money, indeed, was lacking.  
"O man, man, man--man Alan!  
"Ay" said Alan, "I see that."  
I thought Alan flushed a bit.  
"And how shall we send that word?"  
"Could ye lend me my button?"  
said Alan, "I have nae others.  
True, it was more than I had.  
"Once there, David, it's mere pitch-and-toss.  
pointing to one on the north-eastern sky.  
So now, David man, be brisk!"  
"There shall be no sleep the night!"  
"Very well, then," said Alan.  
"Well, Mr. Stewart, come awa', sir!"  
"And how is yourself, Cluny?"  
"O, just for a loan," said he.  
"O," says I, "I have nothing."  
He seemed disconcerted; at which I was meanly pleased.  
Are ye to say it again?  
"You asked me to speak," said I.  
I ken you're a fine jumper!"  
I cannae draw upon ye, David.  
"No," said I, "not without help.  
Again he came near sobbing.  
"'Deed, and I don't know" said Alan.  
"Do ye mean my father, sir?"  
"Well, I wouldnae wonder," said Alan.  
Have ye music, as folk say?  
"Eat and drink; I'll follow you."  
And he made as if to rise.  
"This'll never do," said Alan.  
At last he stopped in the way.  
"Man, David, that's good news."  
said she, in a tearful voice.  
"No," said he, "ye're not that kind.  
"I couldnae," said she, shaking her head.  
"No," said he, "but if ye could?"  
Shall we go wanting, lassie?  
"It sounds like a dream," said I.  
That was in August; dear me!  
He may not have told you all.  
says my uncle, angrily.  
"Ou, just this way," says Alan.  
And where would I be with my blunderbush?"  
"Eh, man, whae's denying it?"

"We'll have nae bloodshed, if you please."  
"Ye're unco scrupulous," sneered Alan.

It's loike a young lord he looks."  
Cedric inquired,--"or earls?"  
Cedric slipped down from his stool.  
"What's the matter, Mary?"  
he inquired anxiously.  
"An' the nobility an' gintry.  
He seemed not at all displeased.  
returned Mr. Hobbs, stoutly.  
Let 'em try it--that's all!"  
"Thank you," said Ceddie; "I'm all right.  
"No," returned Cedric, "we haven't.  
"Wha--what did you say your name was?"  
"That was what Mr. Havisham called me.  
"Well," said Mr. Hobbs, "I'll be--jiggered!"  
We love each other so much!  
Mr. Havisham cleared his throat again.  
"That was a long time ago!  
We'll tell her when she comes in.  
She always likes to hear cur'us things.  
I'd do a great many things.  
He cheats, and that makes Dick mad.  
And we'd march, you know, and drill.  
"It will seem like wealth to them.  
"I've been talking to Bridget."  
Ceddie flew out of the room with it.  
It's for you and Michael!"  
Cedric was in high spirits.  
"Mr. Hobbs thought I'd had a sunstroke.  
Then he winked his eyes again.  
"I've allers thort a heap of him.  
"I've run all the way," he said.  
"I've come down to see ye off.  
They didn't want to let me up.  
It is a beautiful place.  
"Yes," said Cedric, "that's it.  
Don't you think that's it, too?  
It surprised him when they laughed.  
It takes the strangeness away."  
Mrs. Errol smiled faintly.  
Then she looked at the lawyer.  
"This is very strange," he said.  
"He will be very angry.  
Make yourself comfortable.  
What kind of a lad is he?  
"Straight-limbed and well enough to look at?"  
It was Mr. Havisham who broke it.  
The Earl started visibly.  
Mr. Havisham repeated his words.  
"She won't spend it," said Mr. Havisham.  
"She shall have it sent to her.  
But Mr. Havisham delivered it.  
The woman seemed pleased, he thought.  
"I like that woman," he said.  
"She looks as if she liked boys.  
"They live here," Mr. Havisham told him.  
"Was it you who sent the cat?"  
It's a great day, this, sir."  
"Dougal," he called, "come back, sir."  
suggested his grandfather.  
"You'd like Dick, he's so square."  
demanded his grandfather.  
"You can go on," said my lord.  
"I'm an American!"  
"Would you like me to help you?"  
"You could lean on me, you know.  
"Do you think you could do it?"  
"I THINK I could," said Cedric.  
"Well," said the Earl, "you may try."  
But they reached the chair at last.  
"It's a warm night, isn't it?"  
He liked this childish courage.  
"What do you think of doing?"  
inquired his grandfather.  
The Earl did not speak again.  
"Good-morning, my lord," said Mrs. Mellon.  
I was very fond of Jim.  
Can I go and look at it?"  
Why do they belong to me?  
Is it something like cricket?"  
"Go and get it," said the Earl.  
"Ring for Thomas," said the Earl.  
"It's not very heavy."  
"And he is always behindhand, Newick tells me."  
He glanced across at Mr. Mordaunt.  
"What would YOU do in this case?"  
said my lord, staring at him.  
he said gayly, "now you can write it."  
"Will it do if I write it?  
"It will do," answered the Earl.  
I'll write it over again."  
"May I go to Dearest now?"  
"Very well," answered the Earl.  
"We will order the carriage."  
Fauntleroy drew a long breath.  
Fauntleroy drew a long breath.  
"I WANT to see it," he said.  
"You think you can't put it off?"  
He talked about the pony.  
What did it like to eat best?  
I shall tell him about you."  
went from one looker-on to another.  
"Thank you, ma'am," said Fauntleroy.  
"And what did she say to that?"  
he exclaimed, "is it Mr.  
Is Mrs. Higgins well now?"  
He has had children himself.  
"Now," said the Earl, "let him trot."  
"No, my lord," answered Wilkins.  
"You'll get used to it in time.  
said the Earl to Fauntleroy.  
It is a present from YOU."  
he cried, "could you believe it?  
He made plans for his future.  
It was he who talked the most.  
"Been neglecting it--has he?"  
The rain comes in at the roof!  
"Only one thing," he answered.  
The old Earl winced a little.  
Then the Earl knitted his brows.  
"It is disgraceful, Harry!"  
"I know it wouldn't," she answered.  
And he is so proud of him!  
He is never offensive."  
And she kissed him on his cheek.  
She has a son five years old.  
"I might have known it," he said.  
This is a hot day--isn't it?"  
Gone to be one o' them lords."  
he exclaimed, "d' ye know him yerself?"  
"That's so," said Mr. Hobbs.  
The plan pleased Dick well enough.  
"I'd like to know more of the particklars."  
Some of us boys 're takin' it to read."  
said Mr. Hobbs, anxiously.  
Mr. Hobbs was much disturbed.  
An' if I didn't have to 'tend it!  
Tell you, he was spoons on her.  
"They can take nothing from her."  
he exclaimed, in wonderment.  
She does not know what to do.  
"It's the Earl hisself, ma'am!"  
she said in tremulous awe.  
"Mrs. Errol, I believe?"  
"Mrs. Errol," she answered.  
"I am the Earl of Dorincourt," he said.  
So no more at present  "DICK."  
I say, what's the matter?"  
The young man began to laugh.  
"I know her and she knows me."  
"Are you quite sure you want me?"  
"Just like the Fourth of July!"

"HE IS DIFFERENT"   CHAPTER IV.  
THE ROAD TO THE RIGHT   CHAPTER VII.  
"NOTHING HAS HURT YOU"   CHAPTER IX.  
"DON'T DO NO ONE A ONJESTICE"   CHAPTER XVII.  
"It is five o'clock," she said.  
I don't think I shall like it."  
"Are you going to your room?"  
"I don't know where else to go.  
"But I don't live there, you see.  
Father could never spare me."  
she asked, with great earnestness.  
"It is rather short-waisted, it is true."  
But she did not reveal it.  
"I would rather have 'Louise,'" she said, disappointedly.  
"Well," returned Miss Ferrol, "'Louise' let it be."  
she whispered to Miss Ferrol one night.  
"Nor of Michael Angelo?"  
inquired Louise, humbly.  
I have got three in my trunk."  
But she could not believe it.  
Olivia asked, at length.  
exclaimed Louisiana.  
echoed Louisiana.  
The child stared at her blankly.  
"I haven't got any," she gasped.  
"Oh, no," interrupted Miss Ferrol.  
"Have you a picture of him?"  
"I think he might not like me."  
"Isn't that----"  "To be sure it is!"  
repeated Olivia.  
I wonder how old she is?"  
She said, simply, 'I do not dance.  
CHAPTER V.  "I HAVE HURT YOU."  
"She's mighty still," they said.  
"Why do you speak in that way?"  
"I don't know what I have done!"  
"Miss Ferrol has gone in," she said then.  
Ferrol could not look away from her.  
"I am bewildered," he said.  
"I am very unhappy."  
I don't want to know the rest."  
I would promise anything.  
"I do not live in New York."  
There seems no reason in it.  
There lay the fascination.  
I--yes, I am sure of it."  
"But this is the better road.  
Her face assumed a set look.  
He is a namesake of mine.  
echoed Louisiana.  
We are only losing time."  
Not that he would have interposed, perhaps.  
She put her hand to her side.  
"Where is my--where is Mr.  
She kept her eyes on his face.  
"Why, ye've got a new dress on!"  
It will be such a good joke."  
"What do ye want me to do?"  
That's joke enough, isn't it?  
"I found him on the back porch.  
She was allers tradin' fur picters fur it.  
"We are plentiful enough."  
He paused there to shake his head.  
he queried, in much surprise.  
"You are very kind," they said.  
Ye haint ben in North Ca'liny before, hev ye?"  
"You do not look well at all."  
The girl got up hurriedly.  
The fresh air will do me good."  
"It--yes, it is a French name," assented Ferrol.  
"You couldn't guess it," he went on.  
he said, when he found his voice.  
"May I ask you to explain?"  
I did not think she would care."  
Louisiana broke in.  
I was very fond of her."  
I want Mr. Ferrol to hear it."  
He wont know why I did it.  
I shall not see you again.  
This is not the place for you.  
She aint notionate when she's at herself."  
"I oughtn't to have gone," she cried.  
Fur instants, any littery man--jest for instants, now?"  
Let it all stay as it is!"  
But at last he spoke:  "Don't ye, Louisianny?"  
"Ye've got a kind heart, Louisianny," he said.  
Let's alter them as kin.  
Let's alter them as kin."  
"Nothin'," he answered, "nothin' caynt.  
I sot an' watched 'em all day.  
"And--they wouldn't come if I did."  
He pulled himself up and smiled.  
"No, boys," he answered, "I ain't.  
"It's some new things ye was a-needin'."  
"They're some things ye was a-needin'," he said.  
"I hope ye'll like 'em, honey."  
An' I went, an' I found out.  
I heern she was very pretty.'  
"Why should I be unhappy?  
she said, "you sweet old father!"  
She put her hand on his knee caressingly.  
Travel an' furrin langwidges an' new ways o' doin'.  
It's what she'd oughter hed long ago.'  
"Don't you love me any more?  
Is your loneliness nothing?  
The people did not want me.  
"Thet's so," he answered, simply.  
"I'd oughtn't to said it," he said.  
Thar aint no need fer it, honey.  
But she would not be restrained.  
Thar aint no need fer ye to blame yerself thataway.  
Will God ever forgive me?  
It come agin me like a slungshot.  
Not that I blamed ye, honey.  
Let's alter them es kin!'"  
I seemed like it was kinder onnecessary.  
But the girl made no movement.  
"Yer pappy, honey--he's sorter cur'us.  
He don't seem to be right well.  
"He was quite well late last night.  
"He was well last night," she said, piteously.  
"He's by hisself, honey."  
"It is Louisiana!  
He was not ill very long.  
Ianthy was powerful--sot on it.  
"Ye'll be happy--" he said, "afore long.  
answered Louisiana.  
"She wasn't but nineteen," grimly.  
Mrs. Nance was scandalized.  
"Perhaps you are right," she said.  
"Won't you say a word to me?"  

## menhardoc.txt  

"I know what I'm about.  
"Well, was I a cur last night?"  
I should like to have a look."  
"What are they going down for?"  
"I should just think not, indeed.  
"Just couldn't think o' such a thing.  
"Three and a half, isn't it, Josh?"  
Ay, I wouldn't mind diving down.  
The idee of a pump pumping air!  
Can't you see the long soft pipe?  
"I want to watch the diver."  
"Into his helmet indeed!  
shouted one of the others.  
Keep on there with that handle, stupids!  
Do you want the man to choke?  
"I know'd the gashly old job was wrong.  
Come away, boy, come away."  
I'll go down and cast him loose.  
"You drove him to do that gashly thing!"  
he cried; "it's round a rock.  
"Why don't you take off them gashly things?"  
"Oh, it was an accident!"  
PILCHAR' WILL AND THE OLD FOLKS AT HOME.  
"Water's wet, specially salt-water.  
"Yes, uncle," said Will, sadly.  
"I don't like the gashly job at all."  
Arn't catching pilchar' and mack'rel good 'nough for you?  
cried Will, with his eyes flashing.  
"Well, I can see it, can't I?"  
"How much is there here--five-and-thirty fathom?"  
"Two of you," said Josh gruffly.  
You're sure you can haul me up?"  
What do you take me for--a babby?"  
It looks a gashly sort of a hole.  
"All right, Josh; lower away!"  
"The candle's nearly done."  
growled Josh, wiping his wet brow.  
"What's he doing of now?"  
"Here, go back and get a rope."  
I want you out of this unked place."  
he shouted; "I'll make her sway.  
Then an idea struck him.  
He could not utter a word.  
"Yes--I think so," faltered Will.  
But there, you couldn't help it, I s'pose.  
It's impossible now."  
"Nobody," he said gruffly.  
"But who lent you the rope, Josh?"  
Why didn't you think o' this here?"  
"Steady it is, lad, steady.  
I've been looking everywhere."  
"Hearty," said the boy, laughing.  
"Nay, my lad, I'm the crew.  
This is my brother Arthur.  
said Josh in tones of disgust.  
cried the boy, taking the hook.  
said Josh in indignant tones.  
"And you don't know what a creeper is?"  
"Then how do you catch your fish?"  
"How do you know where it is?"  
"Why, you'd be sea-sick," said Josh, laughing.  
"Weather going to be fine?"  
"Can't I go with Dick, papa?"  
"I say, does he live with you?  
"Yes, that's my home," said Will.  
"Do you live with your uncle?"  
I'm glad to see you, sir.  
"It's a beauty," he cried.  
"You shall taste our honey.  
Young gentleman from London.  
Over the chimney-glass the snout of a sword-fish.  
Let me give you a bit o' 'am."  
Dick Temple flushed like a girl.  
"Not very often," said Will.  
what's that--to make cigars?"  
cried Dick; "why, it's horrid.  
Why, this is worth a hundred Londons.  
I say, what a big buoy!"  
"Yes, and little tiny hooks.  
"See how clear the water is!"  
Don't put your bait on like that."  
"I've seen them at the fishmongers'," cried Dick.  
"But full of sharp teeth," said Will.  
"Put her along, Josh," he said.  
"Go along," cried Dick laughing.  
"Pull it in and see," said Josh.  
"A rock pollack," replied Will.  
well, you've handled her, my lad.  
Why, where are you going now?"  
At least I wouldn't say I did."  
"Does it come above water?"  
"Do what come above water?"  
"No, there arn't," growled Josh roughly.  
"Yes; the rigging of a ship."  
"Yes; but what's a trawler?"  
"These are creepers that we've just put down; grapnels."  
They're oftener down below.  
"They're after the brill," said Will.  
"So we do," cried Josh, "sometimes."  
cried Dick, ready with the hook.  
"Why, there can't be," began Dick.  
"Then they would smell it," said Will.  
To be sure it is," said Will.  
"But I thought congers were very big."  
"Cheerily ho, my lad; well done," cried Josh.  
No use to fish any more to-night."  
some one shouted in his ear.  
"Here he be," shouted back Josh.  
Seen either o' the buoys?"  
"Yes, you can," said Will firmly.  
"Well done, young un; out with it.  
it is horrible," said Dick, piteously.  
Shall we ever get ashore?"  
full of promise of action.  
"They'll soon get a boat," cried Will.  
Let 'em know which way to row."  
"I should if I had a boy."  
"He'll have been in such trouble.  
Then Dick gave two short whistles.  
"That's your sort, Master Dick!"  
I didn't want the doctor fetched."  
I was much better at home."  
"I mean while we were fishing.  
I never saw it again."  
Get out, you sneering old Taff!  
"I wonder whether--yes--five!"  
I thought our salt-water wouldn't hurt him.  
When would you like breakfast, sir?"  
Yes, I do," cried Dick sharply.  
"There's Josh, and there's Will.  
"Yes, father," said Dick humbly.  
"Don't tell me a falsehood, sir!"  
cried Mr Temple hotly.  
Don't let me see that again."  
"Not half so well as Will, sir.  
said Mr Temple, smiling.  
"Not going out with your boots?"  
"Boots, not boots," said Josh, grinning.  
"Think your uncle would mind, Will?"  
I've got such a bad headache."  
"Oh, yes, I was so hungry."  
We've been down to the harbour."  
It may be a little rough."  
I did not see to your clothes.  
"No, papa; only my hat."  
I saw straw hats hanging up.  
said Arthur furiously.  
"I'll go and buy you a hat.  
"What a rum fellow Taff is!"  
why, they've shrunk with being dried.  
Here, let's pull the legs down.  
You've put your legs through too far."  
"What's the matter, my boy?"  
said Mr Temple, smiling.  
"Do you mean that great rough thing?"  
"Is the sea very deep here?"  
The idea seemed frightful.  
"Now have a try for a fish.  
Come and sit here; change places."  
Let a little more line out."  
"Oh, what a fellow you are!  
Pull away hand over hand.  
I know he's a monster."  
cried Josh, who had ceased rowing.  
"Mind his back tin, Master Dick!"  
cried Dick, whose hand was bleeding.  
"I say, isn't it a beauty?  
"You will come, I suppose, Dick?"  
"Then you've a good nerve, my lad.  
"You wouldn't care to go down, Dick?"  
"Don't you get any bites, sir?"  
"Did you put on a good bait?"  
cried Arthur excitedly.  
"Small pollack," said Will smiling.  
I want to catch a large one."  
"Is it safe to go in here?"  
he cried; "there's no tin here."  
"Copper, sir, and tin and zinc."  
said Arthur impatiently.  
"Well, ain't I showing of you!"  
"Yes, sir," said Will, colouring.  
"Then there is copper here too!"  
"Then don't take Master Dick, sir.  
well, I can't stand that," growled Josh.  
This done, he smelt his fingers.  
"I wonder how long they'll be!  
said Dick, who had caught the term.  
"But where does the water go?"  
"Now, then, who'll lead the way out?"  
said Mr Temple sharply.  
You are acting like a child."  
"Oh, how unlucky I am!"  
"I have a small keen knife here.  
Here, you hold his leg on the gunwale.  
Pinch the hook with your fingers.  
and then Will stood up smiling.  
He hurt me then horribly!  
said Arthur, feeling his leg.  
said Mr Temple to Josh.  
Somewhere about here, wasn't it?"  
It was like being on ice."  
Don't _you_ come aboard that way."  
"Oh, I say, what a morning!"  
"Why don't you have a bathe, Josh?"  
"No, I can't see anything."  
"Look at that chap on the cliff!"  
Why, try and catch that school of mack'rel.  
"Oh, they shoot rubbish, do they?"  
but I'm ashamed of you!"  
"What are they going to do?  
"All out now," said Josh at last.  
"Why, how big is this net round?"  
"I am so sorry, father!"  
"Because they sting," replied Will.  
said Mr Temple smiling.  
cried one of the fishermen.  
"Ay, hand 'em over," said Josh.  
"You mean dog-fish," said Mr Temple.  
said Josh shortly; "soon be half."  
shouted the captain of the seine-boat.  
"Hadn't we better get ashore?"  
cried Dick; "we shall see better."  
Keep off the net there, you boys!"  
"It would be such a treat, too."  
Why, he's a splendid chap.  
I'm busy testing ere."  
"Go and play down on the shore."  
Never mind, let's shake hands.  
It's too bad, that it is.  
"Yes, you had better come, sir."  
We'll have everything ready."  
No," said Arthur, turning pale.  
"Why, they must be regular nippers!"  
"Why, they're regular sea-serpents," said Dick.  
"Basking in the sunshine, Josh."  
DICK CATCHES HIS FIRST CONGER.  
cried Arthur excitedly.  
"That ought to do it," he said.  
"Now she's at the bottom."  
Reg'lar home for 'em among these rocks.  
"Why, how big do they grow, then?"  
"Josh, there, saw one a hundred.  
Now, you see, ease him a bit."  
Now you shall catch another."  
whispered Josh; "you'll have them hear."  
"Then you won't be," whispered Josh.  
I'm not going to fish.  
we'll give 'em a startler directly.  
We'll show 'em what conger be."  
"But the people--the people?"  
"Hadn't we better let it go?"  
Give him line, as I showed you afore.  
"Shall we leave the line and go?"  
"Well, that arn't very likely.  
"He's going away now.  
"He is a big one," cried Josh.  
She won't get out of the boat."  
"How did you get on, Arthur?"  
"Were you very much alarmed?"  
"Here, what a stupid I am!"  
Now, what do you think of that?"  
It won't blow me down, will it?"  
"No; not there," said Will smiling.  
"It's generally so."  
"How can you be so absurd?  
It will blow here directly."  
Let's get back to the edge."  
"I'll try and show you," said Will.  
It can't go through it, can it?"  
"Where is the wind to go, then?"  
"Why, upwards of course," cried Dick.  
"Well, I should catch you," said Dick.  
I say, how can we get it?"  
"We can't get it now," he said.  
"It is too rough to go out."  
It's too rough to stay in.  
"I don't think it rains, does it?"  
"It's the old gentleman.  
Things veers about, sir, sometimes."  
"Good neighbour o' mine, you see.  
You said nothing of the kind."  
"That's a bargain then, sir?"  
It's kep' me awake for nights."  
A TERRIBLE TIME AT SEA.  
"Some boat has been lost, hasn't there?"  
"Here comes father after us.  
cried Mr Temple quickly.  
there she is speaking again."  
"Haul back quick," the latter said.  
"And you left that boy to drown!"  
Won't have the litter, she says.  
"Novels and romances, eh?"  
Can't do the boy any harm."  
Those are what his aunt likes best.  
I don't want him to see us.  
said Mr Temple, smiling.  
said Mr Temple dryly.  
There, go and enjoy yourselves.  
"So you've come a-trawling, have you, my lad?  
"Going to stop aboard, lads?"  
"The ship's going over."  
She only careens a bit."  
"The deck's all of a slope."  
"Oh, yes, that's right enough.  
"Oh, I say, Taff, isn't it fun?  
I say, Taff; don't be afraid.  
"There, think about something else.  
"And the rope's tied to them?"  
said Arthur curiously.  
Are you going to begin?"  
We shall have the trawl aboard soon."  
"There's such a lot," he cried.  
"Don't sit down, Taff; dress yourself.  
Here, Will, he says it's cold.  
Come and let's tug him out."  
cried Arthur indignantly.  
How would to-day do to visit the seal-cave?"  
"You never will wait for me."  
"We can catch no end to-night with these."  
It is not fair to you boys."  
"It looks a rum place," said Dick.  
"Why, the water goes right in.  
"No fear o' knocking your head.  
said Dick in the same low tone.  
"He's making fun of you.  
They won't have got out either.  
"How far is it to the end?"  
We'll have a good look at them.  
You won't see no more seals, sir, to-day."  
"What do you say to it, Will?"  
What a long time father is!"  
Steady, Dick, take these pieces.  
said Mr Temple sternly.  
I'll try," said the boy quickly.  
cried Mr Temple sternly.  
"We should be suffocated."  
"What time is it high water?"  
Then there was utter silence.  
That cigar-case was not Dick's, but mine."  
"Hours yet," growled Josh--"eh, Will?"  
"It annoys them," whispered Will.  
"Now, all together--hip-hip-hip hooray!"  
"Is Will Marion at home?"  
"You idle, good-for-nothing, useless creature.  
Busy day with her, you see.  
"She don't mean nothing by it.  
"My father wants him," said Dick sturdily.  
'Member what I said, Master Dick, sir."  
He is fond of me, I know."  
"It hurts me, it does indeed.  
Taff came and said that to you?"  
"Here's Will, father," said Dick.  
"Let me finish this letter."  
"Yes, sir," said Will with an ill-suppressed sigh.  
"And your parents are both dead?"  
said Mr Temple sternly.  
cried Mr Temple sternly.  
"Are you going to do it?"  
continued Mr Temple.  
"I don't understand you, sir."  
said Mr Temple sharply.  
"You are not playing with me?"  
cried the old lady fiercely.

My word, how handsome you look!"  
"So you do, sir, so you do!  
"Ever so much, Dick," said the middy.  
"Four times altogether, sir.  
"Those are the pirates' boats, Dick?"  
"Honour bright, sir; lots on 'em.  
yes, sir; there's elephants."  
and I could double your dose."  
But don't be rash, my dear boys.  
"Thank you, doctor," said Major Sandars.  
"I did not know you were there."  
said Captain Smithers, rather hoarsely.  
"Or was it fancy, doctor?"  
It's liquid poison, sir!  
"Well, well, well; I didn't mean all.  
"That is part of Sumatra.  
The major walked up just now.  
I hope you are better, Sim?"  
"There, now walk across the deck."  
Here I think I shall drop it.  
that's very curious.  
"That chap darted at him then."  
Lovely thing, isn't it, Smithers?"  
"What can I do next, doctor?"  
"He brought me in on his back.  
"Thank you, my dears, thank you," he said.  
"Why, can't you see for yourselves?  
"That's a tiger, isn't it!"  
That can't be close to the shore."  
How is your patient, Bolter?"  
"You, Bob," said Tom Long, coolly.  
"Here, let's look at some fruit."  
"That fellow ought to be shot.  
"I believe you saved my life."  
Here there was another laugh.  
"Are you much hurt, old fellow?"  
"Here, who has a little rack?"  
"Ensign Long, sir," some one said.  
said Bob Roberts, anxiously.  
"I don't think I'm much hurt."  
"Yes," said Tom Long; "more or less."  
"Sounds like something swimming, sir.  
There, you can hear it blowing."  
Dick Dunnage, you keep her fast with the boat-hook."  
HOW BOB ROBERTS WAS NOT DROWNED.  
"Not two miles, I should think, sir."  
said the lieutenant, kindly.  
"Not one man killed, though," he said.  
"Six, sir, but only slightly."  
"No, sir," said the lieutenant dolefully.  
"Just like my luck," grumbled Bob.  
I wish I had had the kris.  
How do you do, Miss Linton?"  
I mean the other," cried Bob.  
"Say it again, please," said Bob.  
"Why, you silly, foolish boy!"  
"Do you mean to be a goose?"  
I am sorry he's hurt."  
A DISCUSSION UPON WOUNDS.  
"Kris, right through my left shoulder.  
You always get off all right."  
"Do you think they are poisoned?"  
You'd better go to sleep, Long."  
"Wound pains me too much, doctor.  
Isn't that a sign of poison?"  
"I wish I had," sighed Tom Long.  
"But you didn't eat all those things?"  
"Wait a wee, dear boy," said Bob.  
"Don't get riled if I tell you."  
"Well, but what did he propose?"  
"Why, confound his insolence!"  
Captain Horton wishes it."  
Can you understand English?"  
"What Tom--I mean Ensign Long?"  
He got hurt up the river."  
"Yes," said Bob; "I suppose so."  
"Now come and see round the ship."  
"I have seen plenty of ships.  
It's awfully hot here."  
May I be an intimate?"  
"Well, Turkish; the language of Roum.  
But is there any shooting?"  
"But about our shooting?"  
"Pretty bobbish, I believe," said the middy.  
"But you are not, my dear boy.  
I'm not the commandant.  
"Hallo, Long, what are you doing here?"  
"See it, Master Roberts, sir?  
"Oh yes, I dare say," said Bob.  
"I say--I am glad," said Bob.  
"Them's our own two boats.  
"Good-night, sentry," said Mary Sinclair.  
"It is a boat of some kind."  
"I thought it was the sergeant."  
"You untrustworthy villain!"  
cried the lieutenant, sharply.  
"Now then, old man, how are you?"  
"There, I told you so," said Dick.  
Now then, have you done joking?"  
"I didn't mean that, sir," said Dick.  
"There now, look at that," cried Dick.  
What, another already!"  
"I like fishing arter all."  
"No, my lad, it's no use.  
"How did the dinghy get loose?  
"Ay, ay, sir; and his men too.  
when a fellow was asleep!"  
"What'll you take for it, Tom Long?  
I think I should like a change.  
We are English officers.  
I say, this one's lovely!  
Don't care much for these niggers."  
"Those sarongs are just like kilts."  
"We'll get leave to-night, and start early."  
"If you please, sir--"  "Who's that?  
Go to the first lieutenant."  
Well, I don't know what to say.  
just hand me that sheet of cork."  
Suppose I shot you some birds?"  
"Nothing I should like better.  
"Exactly," said the doctor.  
I have felt very languid to-day."  
You are a chap," shouted Bob.  
"Well, never mind; jump aboard.  
Got plenty of cartridges?"  
cried Ali, who was behind.  
"I can't stand this any more.  
HOW BOB AND TOM BAGGED STRANGE GAME.  
I shall never forget it."  
"You leave them alone, will you?"  
Confound your impudence, what do you mean?"  
"But suppose they lead us wrong?"  
Naval brigade to the front!  
"No, no, to the `Startler,' I tell you."  
said the ensign, nervously.  
"What fools moths and beetles are!"  
but he did not look angry.  
"I'm very sorry, sir."  
What do you say; shall we go?"  
"Do you think you can get leave?"  
"What, isn't he fond of tigers?"  
"Well, I don't know," said Major Sandars.  
Come, doctor, what do you say?  
"Splendid," said everybody.  
"Gun borrowing, I'll be bound.  
It isn't much pleasure we get."  
"He said you were going, though."  
"No, I don't mean that," said Bob.  
"I say, Bob, do you mean that?"  
"Oh, I say, though," he exclaimed.  
What was that glint of some arm?  
PRIVATE GRAY HAS HIS ORDERS.  
"You'll grow out of it in time.  
He didn't use plenty o' soap."  
Why, what have they gone to do?  
Shoot a big cat all brown stripes.  
all right, master Dick," said the middy.  
"I'll take the lesson to heart.  
"At once," said Captain Smithers.  
said the lieutenant at last.  
"They'll have a storm to-night, and soaked tents."  
I think it's cooler there."  
There's no such luck, Roberts."  
said the lieutenant at last.  
"What's the matter, Charcoal?"  
said Ali passionately.  
asked Ali; "what have I done?"  
"Does my father know of this?"  
How and when would this be done?  
A moment decided that.  
AT THE PRISON IN THE WOODS.  
Still they would not keep him back.  
said the lieutenant kindly.  
"You are on board the steamer.  
cried Ali excitedly.  
"He will not believe me, Bob.  
Lie down and have a good sleep.  
cried Ali passionately.  
Is it that I always lie?"  
cried Ali excitedly.  
"That's right, Roberts," he cried.  
May I give him a sword, sir?"  
I'll be very careful, sir."  
at last, there goes the signal."  
"Will that steam never be up?  
Will that steam never be up?"  
I wonder which would be best.  
Now what can I do for you?"  
Here, nobody's looking.  
THE VALUE OF PRIVATE SIM.  
What was the sentry about?  
"I'm ashamed of you, Long!"  
It's a puzzle, isn't it?  
HOW CAPTAIN SMITHERS MADE PLANS.  
Do you think you can reach her?"  
There you are; fix 'em in tight.  
I'm glad we were in time.  
"Of course, sir; of course," said Gray, huskily.  
"There is another--two more.  
"But against your own people?"  
Wilson, come and take his place."  
cried the man; but old Dick growled.  
"May I ask what that is, sir?"  
said the engineer, laughing.  
Let's do it mentally.  
What is my position here?  
"I will go myself," he said.  
The two young men stared at him.  
"That the men would lose their lives!"  
"And yet you would run that risk?"  
"No, no; I mean gong--Tumongong," cried Bob.  
"Oh, yes," said Ali, smiling.  
"But no, no: that is a dream.  
"But have you thought of the risk?"  
"But shall we see you again?"  
It was a splendid disguise."  
HOW BOB FISHED FOR MISS LINTON.  
"Take them to the ladies, sir."  
yes: of course, the ladies first.  
said the captain, eagerly.  
"And yet it seems feasible?"  
exclaimed the young officer.  
"But won't you go forward, sir?  
We must be near the stockade!"  
Oh, that we could be such fools!"  
It was as he suspected.  
said Captain Smithers, sternly.  
"What were you doing there, Gray?  
"I could not sleep, sir," said Gray.  
"Sergeant, change the sentry here.  
said Gray in a low, stern voice.  
"Mr Ali, is that you?"  
cried Gray, leaning towards him.  
cried Captain Smithers; "you here?"  
"How we have been deluded!"  
there are some more of them, though."  
"They are doubled in number.  
They are coming on at once!"  
"They are the scum of the east."  
There must be some about here."  
"Yes, you shoot one," said the boy.  
cried the doctor in dismay.  
Then make gun speak and kill him!"  
"You are good," he said at last.  
The tigers are better than Hamet."  
said the doctor, quietly.  
The man got up for answer.  
"Don't go back, master," he cried piteously.  
"Yes," said the Malay, sadly.  
"I should have told him a lie.  
Now lead me back to the camp."  
"We will," said the resident.  
"Good-bye, then; and God bless you!"  
You're a good fellow, doctor.  
Will some man among you speak?"  
"And what is that opinion?"  
cried the men, as with one voice.  
shouted the men in chorus.  
"I hope not," said the major.  
I cannot leave the steamer."  
"Fire a big gun," said Bob.  
"And the captain and Major Sandars?"  
Will you help us aboard, mates?"  
cried Tom Long, waving his sword.  
"No," cried Tom Long; "a steamer!  
I little thought it was you.  
He has won, and I have lost.  
"I call it beastly," said Tom.  
I'm sorry he's gone!"

HOW MARK STRONG WANTED TO GO.  
You're as bad as your mother."  
Let's see; how old are you?"  
"Sixteen, and discontented!  
Well, of course I have a few.  
I say: do take me with you."  
Your mother is with me there.  
"Won't trust you," said the captain.  
Tell the girl to show him in."  
HOW BILLY WIDGEON BROUGHT A LETTER.  
Heave off, you ugly lubber!  
"No, he won't bite friends," said Mark.  
No, m'lad, I won't wear out the mat.  
"I'll leave you now, dear," she said.  
It's somewheres about me."  
cried the captain angrily.  
"Yes; he sha'n't hurt you now," cried Mark.  
"What did you do to the dog?"  
said the captain angrily.  
"Now, then, youngster, lot him go.  
Come on, you ugly big-headed lubber.  
I'm ready for you now."  
"Are you Mr Gregory?"  
"Yes, sir, I am; and what then?"  
Mark, my lad, here you are then.  
"Do you want him to stay then?"  
You wait till the sun's out."  
"They are no worse than monkeys."  
Widgeon popped his hands in his pockets.  
"The work those men are doing."  
"You're a lucky one," he said.  
I should be glad to," cried Mark.  
"Then why did you say you couldn't?"  
"We've been at work; let's coal.  
"You've brought that dog with you, then?"  
No steaks and new bread at sea."  
Think there was mustard on it?  
"Yes, sir, we're capital friends."  
"No business on board ship, though.  
Was she such a bad sailor?"  
"Mr Morgan wants you, sir."  
"One on 'em, sir, right below."  
"Where do you suppose he is?"  
"Stowaway, my lad," said the second-mate.  
HOW BRUFF SHOWED HE HAD A NOSE.  
"Are you sure it isn't a cat?"  
It's a man or a boy.  
"Here, what do you make of it?  
of some one in sore distress.  
He paused, and they all listened.  
"It's just as if he were practising ventriloquism.  
"Rough work this, my lad, isn't it?"  
Good old man!--no, you can't help.  
Let's have out this case next."  
"Yes, he's coming round now.  
I was nearly killed down there."  
"I'd no money, and no friends."  
Could you lay out on the foretop yard?"  
"Anywhere, sir, anywhere.  
"Yes, to the police station.  
"Everything's the matter.  
"How came you to do this, sir?"  
I'll--I'll do anything, sir.  
"Ay, ay, sir," said the boatswain.  
"Ay, ay, sir," cried the boatswain.  
"What did you say was your name?"  
"More's the pity, my lad.  
"Nothing of the kind, my boy.  
You're as bad as your mother."  
Was it day or was it night?  
Come, can't you hold up a bit?  
I never was in a worse!"  
"Are we--nearly at Plymouth?"  
What are you going to do?"  
"Well, I said I wouldn't take you."  
HOW CAPTAIN JACK CAME ON DECK.  
Here, Jack, shake hands with the gent."  
But we must have no fighting.  
"He won't bite now, will he, sir?"  
"It's all right: do you hear, stoopid?  
Oh, I do feel so giddy.  
"Try and be a man," said Mark.  
My head's all of a swim."  
"I can't--I daren't move," he said.  
shouted a familiar voice.  
"What are you going to do?"  
"Don't send him aloft again.  
"Then what do you think, Billy?"  
"Call him off, Mr Mark, sir."  
HOW BRUFF SOUNDED THE ALARM.  
you're going to sleep again.  
"I'll slip on something and come."  
Quite awake now, sir," said Mark wonderingly.  
"No; he could not be, I think.  
Hark, there's the monkey too."  
"There, go down and quiet him.  
"Well, have you quieted him?"  
"Are you sure you smelt fire?"  
we are in a sore strait now.  
Who first noticed the fire?"  
he must not be burned to death.  
Now, sir, you have your orders.  
"Now then, two men--volunteers.  
"That's right," said the captain cheerily.  
"Where's Mr Gregory?"  
said the major, and passed on.  
"The fire is increasing."  
"I want to know where they are."  
"Matches--did you say matches?"  
"Yes, sir, onion phosphory smell, you know."  
"Axes, my lad, and lanterns.  
Now, my lads, we've nearly won.  
"'Bout his being so ill, sir.  
You know what a drill is, sir?"  
"More, sir; ever so much more.  
"Well, that would be kindness, sir.  
I must try another way."  
"Oh, yes, Billy, easily."  
"That's your sort," said Billy.  
HOW MARK FIRST TASTED JUNGLE.  
"Clever sailors they are too."  
"Should you think these are pirates?"  
But there is not much to fear.  
"Trading among the islands.  
You'll go with them, Gregory."  
"Then why did you talk like that?"  
"You'd better be careful, sir.  
"Yes, call him," said the major.  
Why didn't we keep up with them?"  
"Why, Bruff, old chap, what is it?"  
"Put the game in the bag, sir?"  
said Billy respectfully.  
"I did not fire the shot."  
Shall I give him the knife, sir?"  
Let me go first, I can run."  
"Hadn't we better share their fate?"  
There: it is our duty.  
shouted the major fiercely.  
"Sorry I am so helpless."  
You are in hospital, sir."  
"They will not kill, will they, sir?"  
"The flag, Mr Gregory.  
"Not much of a speech, were it?"  
"Oh, yes, Mr Gregory."  
"No," said Mark confidently.  
"We shall have to wait for day."  
"From the ship," said Gregory.  
"Major, this is horrible.  
"Here, pull that starboard oar, Small."  
"I heard the orders given.  
"But we heard firing, father?"  
Now, Strong, how do matters stand?"  
"And the men--down below deck?"  
"Which do you think is best, Strong?"  
No, sor; fight, sor, fight, of course."  
"Will you stand by us, my lads?"  
But won't they hear us on deck?"  
There, shall I give the signal?"  
"Try me," replied the first-mate gruffly.  
"What are you going to do?"  
said the captain pleasantly.  
Keep a good heart, as I do.  
he added in a whisper.  
"Now reload," said the captain.  
"I feel as if I couldn't sleep to-night.  
Now, sir, why don't you turn in?"  
"Have I been asleep, father?"  
Go out and see how things are."  
"Have you heard the Malays, sir?"  
what are you going to do?"  
how badly he steers the boat!"  
"You were getting hard pressed there."  
Look how young Mark Strong takes it.  
I should like it immensely.  
I've only spoken my mind."  
"What's we going to do?"  
"We have done our duty.  
They'll take alarm directly."  
"Is the ammunition down?"  
"You proposed burning the ship."  
"Yes, there is no doubt of that."  
"We are far out of hearing."  
"What caused that explosion there?"  
"We are heavily-laden and ought to make land."  
But it is all I can do.  
HOW HELP CAME IN TIME OF NEED.  
Why, Mark, my lad, good morning."  
"That's right," said the major.  
"You don't know where we are, then?"  
Just then there was a low moan.  
what are you talking about?"  
There are the cocoa-nuts to begin with.  
Oh, here is one of the men!"  
Mark turned to go eagerly.  
"I know," said Mark eagerly.  
"Three on 'em," he cried, "and good uns."  
"I'm a bit skeert about it."  
That was an English bull, Mark."  
cried Billy, slapping his leg.  
"Then let 'em fall, and `below!'  
Let's have 'em," said Billy.  
"Don't you see he's busy?"  
"A warmint--that's what I calls him.  
HOW MARK STRONG PASSED A BAD NIGHT.  
said the major, coming up.  
"You have heard nothing before?"  
"Well, something of that kind, sir.  
"Is that something it has killed?"  
"He must have been a big un."  
"He must have broken the line."  
Some kind o' shark, I should say.  
"I'll answer that question then.  
"Which way are we going, sir?"  
"Are you going straight inland?"  
"Now for something for dinner!  
load again," said the major.  
He must have stayed back to feed."  
There, lad, fifty yards away."  
I hope we shall have no storm to-night.  
Why, Mark, the pigeons are gone!  
I hung them upon that branch."  
"Might be," replied the major.  
"Well, I mean this, Mark, my lad.  
"Not empty-handed, you see."  
"Much better, and sitting up.  
Every one is hungry."  
"Now for a good drink," he said.  
"And it's quite hot," said Mark.  
"Shall I try the water first?"  
said Mark, rising wearily.  
cried the major angrily.  
Try and get a right and left.  
came faintly from a distance.  
cried Mark; "we can't leave the birds."  
"Yes; that's the worst of it.  
Mark, my lad, never mind me.  
I don't suppose I shall hurt.  
So I should be if I went.  
"Run for it while there's time."  
Then a terrible silence.  
Then once more came the loud yell.  
"I say you escaped," said Mark.  
"But how did you get ashore?"  
"Then the ship is ashore here?"  
cried the major joyfully.  
cried the stowaway wildly.  
Come along," said the major.  
Here, this will do--by this point.  
"Why, Jack, old fellow, frightened?"  
thought Mark, "and what does this mean?"  
"How long did you have to wait?"  
"Eight, and they are bigger than fowls.  
I--I'm not quite awake.  
Let me help carry the birds."  
There, don't beat about the bush.  
The men laughed and Mark flushed up.  
What's that, Gregory--ten-feet long?"  
"Did you see the snake strike him?"  
said the mate impatiently.  
HOW THEY ENTERED CRATER BAY.  
"His coming here was no dream."  
"Not the least," said the captain.  
"Is it safe to get up, sir?"  
said Billy pitifully.  
Shall we go back the same way?"  
"As I believe it is, sir.  
"The water's clear," said Mark.  
"There, you see," said the captain.  
Nay, nay, my lad, you lie down.  
"What is it you can all see?"  
"Hadn't we two better pull, sir?"  
"He means mischief, that he do."  
"That's your first shark, Mark, eh?"  
"You need not have been ashamed.  
"There is a headland away yonder.  
That's what you was a-thinking about.  
HOW THE CIRCUMNAVIGATORS RESTED AND HEARD NEWS.  
you put your back into it."  
he is a joosty one," cried Billy.  
Anyone going to jyne in?"  
"Now, then, messmet, she's nearly through.  
he continued to the dog.  
The whole ship's a reg'lar cellar."  
And now, how have you got on?"  
"But it smells so horrible!"  
"Very well," said the captain.  
"Want to see it spout again?"  
One was "The Grumbler;" another "The Bear-pit."  
said the captain, anxiously.  
"Was it very hot, my man?"  
I'll break a piece or two off."  
"Hear the steam escaping, Mark?"  
shouted Mark excitedly.  
HOW MARK AND BILLY WIDGEON WENT WRONG.  
"It's the sulphur," cried Mark piteously.  
"How do you account for it?"  
With a stream at the bottom."  
"Nothing but vegetation.  
said Billy in a whisper.  
We must find our way back."  
Now, then, which way does the mud-stream lie?"  
cried Mark again wearily.  
"Find your way back to 'em?--no.  
I can't make it out a bit."  
"Shouldn't wonder, Mr Mark, sir."  
Let's get away, sir, do."  
They might hear, and not like it."  
"No, sir, I aren't a coward.  
But let's try one more shout."  
"I wish we was birds just now.  
Wonder what's for supper?"  
HOW THE ROARING SPOT WAS FOUND.  
"Yes, sir, that's what I mean.  
I'll swarm up and get the nuts."  
It should be on our right."  
"It was an accident, sir."  
"That's what your father said.  
They must be very anxious.  
"But suppose he comes out, sir?"  
"You won't shoot me, gentlemen?"  
"Not this time," said the captain.  
"I'm glad you think so, sir.  
Oh, I say, David, do speak!  
said Mrs Strong eagerly.  
"It will betray where we are."  
"What are you going to do?"  
"What do you propose doing?"  
"How much farther is it, Mark?"  
"About six miles," he replied.  
"Look here, Jimpny, we must wait here now.  
They will pass us if they come.  
he ejaculated, "we have left it too long.  
We must help them to the bay.  
"I'm not so tired now."  
HOW MATTERS GOT TO THE WORST.  
"No; it is from the mountain."  
"What are we going to do?"  
"Have you got everything out?"  
The captain uttered a loud "Hist!"  
But there was his position.  
How are you setting on, Mark?"  
"The mountain seems uneasy."  
said the captain suddenly.  
whispered Mark, taking his hand.  
said the major quietly.  
"Cling all tightly for your lives."  
"Father," he cried, "are you there?"  
"Thank God we are so far safe!"  
"The reports are more distant.  
What do you say, Gregory?"  
"Let's get back to the ship."  
said a voice at his elbow.

Hydrophobia, of course, flashed into my mind.  
"What d'you mean by ill-treating the little dog?"  
answered the man,  
with a sulky scowl.  
So was the point of his nose.  
My weakness  
is old women!  
I stooped and patted his head.  
he asked, backing a little.  
called the boy, interrupting.  
said I as we went along.  
"And who was this young lady?"  
I slep' in the self-same water-butt where Punch was born.  
Are you very fund of that?"  
What is your father's name?"  
TREATS OF AN OLD HEROINE.  
I do believe he knows _you_!"  
Shutting the door, I returned.  
did I say I was puzzled?"  
"When did you beg  
last, granny?"  
I could only  
press her hand.  
"If she  
_could_ return, you mean."  
"Shall I read to you, granny?"  
"Ain't there no pumps in London, stoopid?"  
"Punch," said he, "come here, good dog!"  
Send him up nevertheless."  
"Yell, I ain't surprised at _that_.  
"Vy, ain't the shops full of 'em?  
"Yes, granny, He _will_ provide.  
Some is good, an' some is bad.  
I mostly take up wi' the bad  
'uns.  
"Now, don't let your  
monkey rise, Slogger.  
I'll be back in 'alf an  
hour.  
I learned  
it all afterwards.)  
"Brassey was wery 'ard on me to-night," he thought.  
Not a moment now to lose.  
The cry restored me at once.  
We putt 'im  
in the scullery for the night."  
Have you seen Miss  
McTougall since she--"  

"Miss McTougall!"  
"Miss Blythe, your deliverer!"  
It is such an ugly name.  
"To deliver this parcel."  
"Walk in, then, an' wipe your feet.  
exclaimed Slidder, with widening eyes.  
I will, as sure as you're  
a six-foot flunkey!"  
Ears and tail at once replied.  
In short, I'd make a page-in-buttons of  
you."  
"W'y, the guv'ness, in course--my young lady."  
Set to work, old Sneezer, with a  
will!"  
We asked a blessin' fust, now, didn't we?  
responded Mrs Willis.  
"A week's leave of absence?"  
"Yes, them penny banks 'as done it.  
"Well, what more have you to say?"  
"Is it like Noah's Ark?"  
"But where shall we find armour?"  
That's the  
difficulty.  
was the Slogger's exclamation.  
"Well, now, this _is_ a pleasure!  
"Ah, but they ain't prayer-meetin' 'ouses," rejoined the Slogger.  
exclaimed Robin eagerly.  
"D'you take me for a informer?"  
Slidder was doomed to disappointment.  
I was rejected--of course!  
"You don't know her name, do you?"  
The two  
friends moved with the rest.  
No one else was there, I knew.  
Saying this, I left the house.  
I never had a better.  
I exulted in the  
pace.  
"Which elderly gentleman?  
"You know where the Slogger lives, don't you?"  
I repeated, "oh, Edith!"  
My father's name was  
Blythe!"  
"I'm  
very foolish, no doubt."  
"What are you saying, Robin?"  
"There's nothing wrong, I hope?"  
I'm better--much better.  
exclaimed Slidder, with widening eyes.  
"_Will_ you be quiet, Robin?"  
"Oh, there's that dog again!  
I hastened to  
relieve her.  
"But Robin said so," cried Jack.  
If so--let them  
be puzzled!

"Now, mind," said Rasper, "the first you see!"  
He bolted in--so did we.  
Then began a wild scuffle.  
It was something like a bump!  
"Is this Frederick Batchelor?"  
I flew out into the hall.  
But I restrained my feelings.  
It won't come on with shoving."  
"Fred Batchelor," I replied, deferentially.  
"Hurrah, you're a troublesome!  
"What have you there, Batchelor?"  
I was prepared to resist.  
"Yes," exclaimed Philpot, "it is.  
But there was no helping it.  
No playground for half a week!"  
Write home under Miss Henniker's eye!  
That was worse than anything!  
"It's _miserable_ here.  
said Miss Henniker, I hesitated.  
"I thought so," said the lady.  
I hope you are very well.  
He's as close as an owl.  
She thought she had me, but no!  
"Not much; though I don't know why."  
"Has he been bullying you?"  
I want to go for a walk."  
It _was_ awful; but the risk.  
"Oh, Brownstroke, if you like; or your home.  
Hawkesbury was sent for as evidence.  
"It's a relief to me."  
My fault as much as Smith's.  
Smith, do as you have been told."  
"_You_ have, old man," I replied.  
"Are you awfully sore, Jack?"  
added he, with a low laugh.  
It must be about 3 a.m., I thought.  
However did you get here?"  
Smith leaned over and peered down.  
"Never mind," said Jack, "come on."  
And he had an easy task.  
On the whole I rather liked Hawkesbury.  
"Hawkesbury, I'm sorry to say, Miss Henniker."  
How pleased your chum Smith will be!"  
"I want it, please, ma'am," said Smith.  
We can hand the things in there."  
Hold out your hand, Flanagan!"  
Undo the door at once, sir."  
Whereat this little breeze blew over.  
"Smith, I hear your voice," cried the Henniker.  
I'll speak to him if you like."  
Smith was away at the time.  
"Why did you make him captain?"  
What do you say, Flanagan?"  
I agree to anything!"  
I've got a pen and ink here.  
You don't mind, Smith, I'm sure?"  
Hawkesbury walked on, smiling pleasantly.  
Not that he looked dangerous.  
"What are you going to do?"  
"Are you going to lock Hawkesbury out?"  
At last we saw it open.  
Mr Ladislaw knocked at the Henniker's door.  
"Yes, Miss Henniker; the door is quite free."  
Hawkesbury was the only absentee.  
What should I do without him?  
How was that possible here?  
But that is just where I failed.  
I didn't give my mind to it.  
But this is a digression.  
Then came another:  "News-boy wanted.  
Even this did not tempt me.  
Some of these were most tempting.  
It's him I want to see."  
"That's for `J' too," said he.  
I felt decidedly down.  
I inquired nervously.  
exclaimed Smith, seizing my hand.  
"Where _ever_ is Hawk Street, Jack?"  
"But, Fred, promise me one thing."  
"What's that to do with it?  
Why didn't you say that before?  
"And you call that punctual?  
"You are Frederick Batchelor.  
"And you think you would suit us?"  
Let me see you make it out."  
We don't get much laughing, though."  
"We can't both get on," said Jack.  
As before, he was very uncommunicative.  
"Are there other boys here, then?"  
I saw my mistake in time.  
"This is the parlour," said she.  
"So you was," said Mrs Nash.  
and the youth said "Shan't shut up!"  
Come, out with your handkerchief!"  
"What is the meaning of this?"  
"Then you will come, Jack, won't you?"  
Jack pulled rather a long face.  
Look what you have done to my shirt-front!"  
"I can't help that," said Harris.  
exclaimed Horncastle; "a wretched shop- boy!  
"Time enough in fifty years."  
The same thing every day."  
I should like to have seen him.  
"Yes, Cabbage Street, in Hackney.  
But the fates were against us.  
"You're sure there's a way through?"  
"Shall we make a rush for it?"  
"Look at the state he's in."  
We knocked twice, and no one came.  
Mrs Nash opened the door.  
"I ain't done nothink to you," whined the boy.  
"You let me be, then; do you 'ear?"  
I'll take you back to your home."  
"No," said Jack, pitifully.  
"Fred, I say, he's bolted!"  
When I woke up he was gone."  
I say, the Field-Marshal's behind time.  
We'll give you a lesson, then."  
I did not know what to do.  
Look how you've shocked the young 'un there!  
I coloured up at this speech.  
But it is rather rich, that.  
Well, no accounting for tastes.  
"What are you going to do?"  
said Whipcord, when the meal was over.  
I watched him in amazement.  
"You mean to say you won't fight?"  
Conceited ass that I was!  
No wonder I felt ashamed.  
"Have you had it, Mrs Nash?"  
I cried, in astonishment.  
I tried just now, and couldn't stand!"  
Then I hadn't really got it!  
Larkins came up to my room.  
"It may be it after all.  
This was pleasant, certainly.  
"How much do you earn by blacking boots?"  
"Some days I gets a tanner.  
"He's away ill," I said.  
No, not just as usual.  
"Why, we heard you had smallpox."  
"Did you lay it on yourself?"  
"Please, sir--"  "Why, what is this, sir?"  
Is that all you have to say?"  
You'll do nothing of the sort."  
"Oh, I'll see to that," said I.  
Put me down for that, old man."  
Could anything have been more mortifying?  
"I wouldn't miss it for a lot.  
Is it evening dress or what?"  
Something, at least, was ready.  
We had never settled that.  
Some one asked, "Is this the shop?"  
How do, Mrs Batchelor.  
She's a tidy-looking old body, too.  
"I'm game," said Doubleday.  
We're jist a-going to begin, as the conjurer says.  
"No, thank you," said Flanagan.  
"Jolly evening, wasn't it, Crow?"  
for the vanity of youth!  
How are you after it all?"  
We all thought so, didn't we, Crow?"  
"There wasn't much to tell," I said.  
"But you soon got over that?"  
Why, if it ain't t'other flat come back?  
_I_ ain't no flat, no error!"  
replied the boy, with a grin.  
asked Jack, changing the subject.  
"'Tain't no concern o' yourn; so it ain't."  
It's a good one, isn't it?"  
Hold your noses, you fellows."  
Going to behave now, eh?  
Do you hear that, Batchelor?  
"Lively lot they are," said he.  
said I, taking the picture.  
"Is she your only sister?"  
"Slap bang, here we are again!"  
I felt utterly ashamed.  
Well, I couldn't quite make it out."  
cried he, with a profound grin.  
You'll get on all the better.  
"'Ave any of you blokes saw her?"  
"No," said Smith, "when did she go?"  
Oh my, ain't he a topper?"  
"My friend's a shoeblack," drily replied Smith.  
"Don't be an ass, Doubleday!"  
said Doubleday, with a wink.  
"How ever did you do it?"  
you're used to lobsters, I know."  
demanded the company.  
Don't you pity me, reader?  
"I should rather say he doesn't!"  
I was in a dreadful plight.  
"Eh, what about his father?"  
again demanded Daly.  
"The fellow _will_ have his joke.  
"Do you know how much you owe?"  
It was all my fault, I knew.  
"Afford your great-grandmother!  
So come, none of your gammon.  
Would he ever think of me?  
"Of course not; nobody does.  
"Certainly not," I exclaimed.  
"I want to work now," I said.  
Somebody must have told him."  
I did not reply to this.  
"Yes--go away, do you hear?  
"Your friend Smith's gone," she said.  
"Yes, there's something in that.  
And if you go too we shan't blub.  
Then he stammered out in white heat, "Eh?  
"I don't intend to quarrel.  
"Come along," cried Doubleday.  
I ran as if for my life.  
I dared not look behind me.  
I had escaped after all!  
"What's that to do with you?"  
says I, meaning you, says I.  
"Wasn't it just about a spree?"  
At last it was completed.  
There was a pause after this.  
It spoils my pleasure, in fact."  
There was a cry of "Stop him!"  
"Was he here long this evening?"  
said I, in astonishment.  
"Whose shop did you take them from?"  
Do you suppose I'd go else?"  
exclaimed she; "come, what is it?"  
She made a grab at my arm.  
"Oh, you know who did, do you?"  
I exclaimed, "was it Jack Smith?"  
"How punctual you two are!"  
"Not that I'm blaming him.  
I say, governor, look here."  
And yet it made my heart sore.  
"I should like it awfully!"  
"Will it be just you and I?"  
"What are you going to do?"  
Shine 'e all over, governor.  
"What do you smoke, Batchelor?"  
"I don't smoke, thank you," said I.  
"Have you given it up, then?"  
"Don't be modest, Batchelor.  
I didn't like the style of this Masham.  
"I found I couldn't afford it."  
"We may as well humour him.  
They always make me feel sick."  
I'm off my smoke just now.  
should get to know Hawkesbury all you can.  
"That's not what it is," cried Whipcord.  
what's it to do with you?"  
When this was done I sought for Hawkesbury.  
It wouldn't be honourable."  
We've not come to grief so far.  
I had found my friend at last!  
And so it proved in my case.  
"You've got a sitting-room too, I suppose?"  
"About fifty, I should think.  
"You're 'avin' a lark with me," he said.  
But I knows the bloke as was."  
"But did you see me pitched out?"  
"I hope you can stay a bit."  
"Time you knew him, then," said Smith.  
Hawkesbury looked round with an amused smile.  
"Ef you don't you'll get a topper."  
Jack watched me incessantly.  
"At Packworth, of all places," I said.  
"I can't exactly tell you.  
"Oh, that's all right," said Jack.  
"What have you been doing to Petty-Cash?"  
Doubleday whistled softly.  
"Don't mention it," said Wallop.  
"Then there's Tucker, the pastrycook, wants half-a-sov.  
"You were speaking of my friend!"  
I could not guess his motive.  
"But I won't let him do it.  
He sighed forgivingly and went to his desk.  
anything to pay him off.  
What was I to think of it?  
"Rot, every bit of it!"  
We walked down disconsolately to the office.  
But such a swell as he was!  
I had seen him rarely since.  
"You couldn't go far wrong with him.  
I've got no one of that sort.  
If he is we'll wake him up."  
Fancy my astonishment!  
I am sure you must want it.  
Smith looked more and more anxious.  
"No, only Billy," said Jack.  
"I want to see him," said Jack.  
That's what I think of you."  
He has never missed before.  
No; but I knows where she is."  
"In the station, for smashin' winders.  
So she's all safe, she is."  
"As if a chap liked me lived anywheres!"  
"I suppose you know it well?"  
"Is Mr Edward at home?"  
"I am," quietly said Jack.  
said Jack, turning round to me.  
I didn't feel comfortable.  
But don't let's talk of that.  
Here the speaker paused again.  
"The hope had gone from my life.  
My savings were exhausted.  
My salary was not due.  
Christ is very pitiful.  
But I could not do it yet.  
"We may be wrong after all."  
"Not yet," said he, quietly.  
You're always stuffing me up.  
`You're 'avin' a lark with me,' says I.  
"All serene," said Jack, laughing.  
Which proved to be the case now.  
He had got on well, he thought.  
It is most interesting."  
But some day she ought to know."  
Jack looked a good deal troubled.  
It's a game to hear her."  
Billy's face overclouded suddenly.  
He had told me he would not.  
What a go if I'd lost it!"  
"What a go if I'd kept it!"  
Whatever had brought him here?  
This, at least, was a comfort.  
"You seem surprised to see me.  
Now, what about your debts, Fred?"  
Thanks for the jolly evening.  
whispered my uncle to me.  
You must fetch his mother, Fred!"  
"There was a struggle," I said.  
"I are better, governor."  
I'm sure more than he has."  
asked I, after a long pause.  
"I didn't mean Billy," said I.  
"Why, what's up with you, Fred?  
"The story of his life, Jack.  
"You are quite right, Jack," I said.  
At least father says it is.  
But I wish it was over."  
he exclaimed, "and Batchelor!  
"So you blacked his boots for him?"  
Arst 'im yourself if you want to know."  
"Oh," he said, "I don't think so.  
But don't let us talk of that.  
Anything fresh at Hawk Street?  
It would only make bad worse.  
"I have a right to be here.  
"Will you go with the letter?"  
he demanded angrily.  
"Then you did hear what was said?"  
exclaimed Hawkesbury, in sudden fury.  
"You know the consequences?"  
he muttered between his teeth.  
No one will disturb you there."  
I struggled all I could, but unavailingly.  
They both seized me as before.  
"We were never there, were we, Masham?"  
What on earth does it all mean?  
"Yes, I never entered it."  
"I was working at my desk."  
"You did not enter this room?"  
"What have you to say to it?"  
said Mr Merrett, sternly.  
He was right, and I saw it.  
"I came to do some work," said Hawkesbury.  
Am I to understand that?"  
I found them both in this room."  
said Mr Barnacle to Hawkesbury.  
I know nothing about it."  
"Jolly awkward fix," said he.  
Mr Merrett touched the bell.  
"No, I said so," replied he.  
"No," exclaimed Hawkesbury, in a white heat.  
He doesn't know where to find it.  
I have private things in it.  
What right have you to touch them?"  
"Then he _was_ here this morning?"  
Where is this boy to be found?"  
"Oh, I could fetch him at once.  
I know where he works," I said.  
"I ain't a-goin' to be arsted no questions.  
Well, what do you want to arst me?"  
"And you know this gentleman?"  
"What sort of person is he?"  
And what colour is his hair?"  
"He's not come back," said Crow.  
"That there bloke--" begins the boy.  
"This one thing I know," says Fred.  
And, reader, I owe it still.

It will be as God wills it.  
Zephaniah gave a snort of displeasure.  
"But the lad is a Papist, Hannah."  
"Look at the sea, yer honour.  
"Look for yourself, yer honour.  
"Well, we might," Larry agreed.  
"At any rate, we can try."  
"Now, Larry, keep her steady.  
"Can you come a bit nearer?"  
Higher and higher it rose.  
This was safely accomplished.  
Chapter 2: For James Or William.  
"But forgive me," he broke off.  
His father now turned to him.  
"Perfectly," Colonel L'Estrange replied.  
"There is Larry," Walter said.  
"I am afraid so, too, John.  
"'But this is between ourselves.  
"I don't know, John," Walter said doubtfully.  
But to be a currier!  
It is true the soil must be tilled.  
"She is indeed," John agreed.  
"Your affectionate friend,  "John Whitefoot."  
He wants to go very much.  
"He goes first to Cork, Walter.  
Put them by the side of mine.  
Chapter 4: The Siege Of Derry.  
One by one, the men dropped in.  
"The council have broken up.  
I have been idle enough.  
What do you want me to do?"  
He is a mere skeleton.  
"Sure an' it wouldn't, yer honour.  
"That he would," Captain Davenant agreed.  
We have wanted you so much.  
Now go, dears, into your castle.  
I did not mean any harm."  
"Oh, John, you haven't had any.  
"Now we will have a story.  
"Come to the walls with me, John."  
We are dying for the cause.  
Henceforward, I hope to be a Christian.  
A slight groan burst from his lips.  
Walter lay with his eyes closed.  
"Then we will take him with us.  
Then he got up, and listened.  
Chapter 7: The Coming Battle.  
"You do look nearly done for.  
He has got the rabbit, too.  
"I feel quite myself again."  
"And now, lads, off with the pot!"  
"And what are you doing here?"  
"It's just that," the man said.  
Thank God I had no children!  
"Why don't you join the army?"  
the man asked his companions.  
Of these, six thousand were French.  
Then would be the time to fight.  
Further back was the pass of Duleek.  
Here they came to a standstill.  
"That is true enough, Godfrey.  
"Sure and I could, yer honour.  
With me, it's different.  
"They are too big," Larry said.  
Larry said, with a slight smile.  
"Two hours' work will do it."  
Then he waited anxiously.  
"'Are you there, Pat Ryan,' says I?  
"'Why, I thought you had gone,' says he.  
"How many will the boats hold?"  
"Thirteen or fourteen men each."  
she gasped out; "then we are safe!"  
Chapter 10: A Cavalry Raid.  
"You were just in time," he said.  
Mrs. Conyers has fainted."  
"How can I thank you enough?"  
"Oh, I will go with you, please.  
Captain Davenant now hurried downstairs.  
I cannot tell you all now.  
"No, I am sure it is not.  
"Very well, Mrs. Conyers.  
So saying, she left the room.  
"Why, what is the matter, Claire?"  
"Oh, Walter, what can I say?"  
You have been talking too much."  
For the troops I can answer.  
Mrs. Conyers said at last.  
"Faith and I do, yer honour.  
Walter at once called Larry.  
Place two pillions behind the saddles.  
He knocked loudly at the door.  
Walter burst into a laugh.  
It is I, with some soldiers.  
"It's a lie," the man said.  
"I think so, too," Captain Davenant said.  
But here come the young people.  
The firing then recommenced on both sides.  
The governor, M'Carty, was wounded.  
But we'll be aven wid them yet.  
"That's all right," the man said.  
"That is serious, Larry.  
"That's true enough, Larry.  
the gentleman said, coolly.  
"You will find no treason here.  
At last he reached the window.  
"Sure and I did," Larry said.  
Then we saw no more of ye.  
"I hope not, sir," Walter said.  
"The three last in the column."  
They were now a pile of flame.  
On his left was a deep glen.  
These were long and obstinately contested.  
The season was getting late.  
"What are you going to do?"  
Walter listened intently.  
It's our only chance.  
Walter was taken first to Kilcowan.  
The whole village was in flames.  
I abandon it at once.  
It seems I was mistaken.  
"And now, how is your father?  
General Hamilton asked.  
"Yes," the general agreed.  
The Irish were disheartened.  
There was no excuse for this.  
"It is out of all reason."

"Oh, you'll see when you get there!"  
Uncle Jack tucked up his sleeves.  
"Very good," said my father.  
"Yes, of course," said Uncle Jack.  
That brightened me up at once.  
"Yes, isn't the place on fire?  
Well, Cob, what do you think of Arrowfield?"  
"When do we begin, uncle--to-morrow?"  
"Well, you're not a man yet, Cob.  
"Mr Tomplin, gentlemen," she said.  
Now what can I do for you?"  
"You've taken the Rivulet Works, I hear."  
"Of course it will, my dear sirs."  
"Then why should they interfere?"  
"But not serious attacks?"  
He's only scaring us.  
The town is always like this."  
They've got police here, and laws."  
"Dirty work brings clean money."  
"Do you notice one thing, Cob?"  
"Why should they throw them in here?"  
Happen yow'll get some'at if yo' stay."  
"I want to go round the place.  
"Open gate, lads, and hev 'em out."  
"I think the place a bargain."  
I said; "and so near the town."  
"But I thought grouse were Scotch birds."  
"Well, what is the difference?"  
"You wait and see," he replied.  
"To be sure," said Uncle Dick.  
"How deep is it, I wonder?"  
"Let's get off it at once."  
"Well done, old conscientious!"  
"I hope not," said Uncle Jack.  
"The weight must be tremendous.  
Hadn't we better go off here?"  
said Uncle Jack thoughtfully.  
"Hadn't we better turn back now?"  
To be sure," said Uncle Bob.  
"So do I," said Uncle Jack.  
A NIGHT OF ANXIETY.  
Now we were separated.  
What was going to happen?  
Its wearer bounded away.  
"Did you see which way it went?"  
"Let me come to you," I cried.  
"Creep close to me, then," he said.  
"We shall keep each other warm."  
"Something breathing against us?"  
cried Uncle Jack from below.  
Let's wait till it's light.  
he said, "I call them wild beasts."  
"See what a state I'm in!  
They've spoiled my second best suit."  
"Very well," said Uncle Dick.  
"What are you going to do?"  
"I have the agent's keys.  
"It will be no work for boys."  
"Pat him, Cob, and pull his ears."  
"Why, he has no ears," I said.  
But isn't he a beauty, Cob?"  
"Mr Tomplin has lent him to us."  
I commenced my attack then.  
I hope that dog will not bark.  
I feel just like a burglar."  
"The small grindstones are theirs, are they not?"  
I shouted, as I dragged Piter back.  
roared the fellow starting up.  
I think I can hold him now."  
"Now you can get up and go.  
I'll go in and fetch him out.  
he said, "I'll pay thee for this.  
"Take care," whispered Uncle Dick.  
"Be ready to bang the gate.  
I'll call you when the men come."  
"You must take your turn with us."  
New grindstones and polishing-wheels, new forges with tilt-hammers, and anvils.  
"I can't say, my boy--who can?  
He would soon give the alarm."  
"No," he said; "certainly not."  
"Yes," he said; "you may as well unchain Piter."  
"We arranged to go to bed."  
He did not say any more.  
Who can answer that question?  
"They're gone, Cob," said my uncle.  
said the first speaker sharply.  
Shall I fire some and try?"  
"Well, what's to be done, boys?"  
It is a desperate business!"  
"We don't want to save it then?"  
Now, lads, what's to be done?"  
"Sometimes," said Mr Tomplin coolly.  
"But such things would destroy life."  
What do you say, my young friend?"  
he added, turning to me.  
"Never mind," said Uncle Dick.  
"But you don't talk nonsense, sir.  
I couldn't go to bed to-night and sleep.  
The boy was there last night, and-- Hullo!  
"That's what we want to know.  
And leave the place to its fate?"  
I'm going to take mine."  
"So am I," said Uncle Dick.  
"Oh, yes, as well as you can!"  
"Oh, Uncle Richard, was it?"  
"Steel was good enough as it weer."  
"That's how I want them made."  
I cried indignantly--"look."  
"Never mind," said Uncle Dick.  
"Oh, but there are," he said; "straange big 'uns.  
"Ah, but that was a partic'lar good week.  
"Terribly," said Uncle Jack.  
"Well, who do you think did it?"  
"Nay," he said; "I nivver touched no bands.  
I cried, "what made you do that?"  
"Dunno," he said hoarsely, "dunno, lad."  
ONLY A GLASS OF WATER.  
He's in his kennel now.  
"You haven't been to sleep, have you?"  
"What a cruel shame it is!"  
"Can't we do something, uncle?"  
Must be some narcotic though.  
"Yow can't drownd him like that," cried one.  
"Howd hard theer," he cried in his shrill voice.  
"To be sure," said Uncle Jack.  
"Never mind," said Uncle Bob.  
"Let's have our breakfast.  
The men are afraid of him."  
I on'y wants to be let alone."  
"No, no," I cried; "you mistake.  
I hate to see people starve."  
"I want you to lend me your clothes-line."  
I should just think not indeed."  
"We sha'n't want the old clothes-line," said Tattsey slowly.  
"Going a wallucking, Mester Jacob?"  
"Have patience," I said laughing.  
Away he goes directly.  
He has to do what trade likes."  
"It's our secret, mind."  
I said, speaking lower still.  
I dare not ask any more.  
"Ain't you well, Mester Jacob?"  
MY TRAVELLING COMPANION.  
"But when should I have to go?"  
said Uncle Jack severely.  
"Don't," he said in a low half-angry voice.  
"Thank you; I don't smoke," I said.  
"Better have a drop," he said.  
There will be the more for me."  
Come and sit down; I sha'n't hurt you."  
"You young idiot, come back!"  
"Am I to come after you?"  
That's the way; edge along.  
Why, my heart was in my mouth.  
"Don't name it," he said, nodding good-humouredly.  
My father shuddered slightly.  
Where did you put the lantern?"  
"On the shelf in the entry."  
Can't you see it is a friend!"  
"It's a-cootin' my leg i' two, I tell'ee."  
Oh, my poor missus and the bairns!  
Hey, bud I'm being killed."  
"You shall stay here till you do."  
I'll help you on to your house.  
"I have it, uncle," I said.  
They don't make open attacks."  
"Working together," I said.  
"It seems funny too," I said.  
"No," he said shortly; "won't do.  
"I'm a downright bad un."  
"Ay, but I am--reg'lar down bad un."  
"Then why are you a bad one?"  
"Man can't do as he pleases."  
We two ain't said much lately.  
"Nay, it's nowt to laugh at, lad.  
And now what was I to do?  
But it seemed so cowardly.  
But it was impossible.  
A COMPANION IN TROUBLE.  
There was no doubt about it.  
But I made one more effort.  
"No, no," I said, shivering.  
"Yow know where we are, o' course.  
"Yes," I said with a shiver.  
"How did you know I was there?"  
I said; and there was a whine.  
"Yes, and I know where," I said.  
"But what have you been doing?"  
I'm comin' back to work next week."  
"And would you do this, my man?"  
"Shall you try and punish them?"  
"Ay, but they'd get another."  
And what a delight that was!  
What did they want to coom here for?"  
"Well, see what a pistol is."  
Wants no loading, and is allus safe."  
"Oh, but I sha'n't be hurt," I cried.  
"No, my boy, you must not stay.  
"Yes, uncle, if there was war."  
"Well, that is shabby," I cried.  
"No, thank you," said Uncle Bob.  
"That you had," said Uncle Bob.  
"Shake hands, Cob, my boy," he said.  
"And with me," said Uncle Bob.  
"Why not wait till after tea?"  
"I'm quite ready to go.  
STEVENS HAS A WORD WITH ME.  
he said at last hoarsely; "are you glad?  
"Fact is, Cob, I've had a scare.  
"We can't look round now," he said.  
The bands again, I expect."  
"And you can find nothing wrong?"  
There, you needn't call thee uncle."  
"Nay, lad, I did nowt to the dog.  
Was it not an accident?"  
"Wish I were twyste as big, mester!  
he said in a hoarse whisper.  
said Uncle Dick one morning.  
"I can't go," said Uncle Jack.  
"I warn't going to stop 'em."  
"There, now thou'lt be easy, my lad.  
"Tak them boots out and brush 'em.  
"I'm not," she said laughing.  
"Hey, but that'll be gone," she said.  
"I feel too much excited."  
The young ruffians--the young savages!"  
ejaculated Mr Tomplin, looking hard at me.  
"But you don't know who they were?"  
cried Uncle Bob eagerly.  
It would have a good effect."  
There are no chips, no scrapings.  
"My Jenny says he went in theer."  
Where had the child tumbled in?  
"Yes, but you--are you all right?"  
Here there was a loud "hurrah!"  
he cried, shaking hands with me.  
"Please, please don't, Mr Tomplin," I cried.  
"Don't say that, my boy," he cried.  
Mester, I'd do owt for you now."  
"What are you staring at, Cob?"  
Do you know what happens then?  
A low piteous moan was the reply.  
"Nay, not all," shouted Stevens.  
cried Uncle Dick with a laugh.  
"But they are," said Uncle Dick.  
"Well," said Mr Tomplin, "we shall see.  
"Because we should not let you.  
Go, Dick, and we'll come with you."  
"Only there is no watchman.  
said Uncle Bob; "the forge blast?  
They may think you are asleep."  
"There is no waste in nature."  
"No," said Uncle Jack sharply.  
"So much the better," I said.  
"Oh, they charge accordingly!"  
"It's very curious.  
We must save our papers.  
"Quick, Cob!--into the office!"  
"Keep cool, all of you," he cried.  
said Uncle Bob gloomily.  
They will float if we take care."  
said Uncle Dick fervently.  
"Can you get a short ladder?"  
"Why, Pannell, don't you know me?"  
"On'y to think o' this being him!"

It was the same old story.

ALL ABOUT THE FAMILY.  
came a chorus of voices.  
Be happy--bless you, darlings!"  
But it can't be true, it can't!  
ALL ABOUT THE FAMILY.  
I will see her presently."  
Polly's face was crimson.  
"Father, I must say one thing.  
"I don't think I like that plan.  
"But I needn't promise, need I?"  
Well, Fly, it rests with yourself.  
Now, look here, wouldn't this be fun?"  
"But you really can't housekeep, Polly.  
You understand me, Polly.  
"Yes, father, yes," said Polly.  
No stinting, and no running in debt.  
Oh, how delighted I am!  
"But one moment, please, father.  
I have not shown you my plan.  
I see my way so clearly.  
Don't I use fine words, father?  
It has little divisions.  
"Then you were the naughty one.  
Now what were those sobs about?  
It was then I came up here.  
What's the discovery?"  
"And I--don't I hate you, just!  
"Everything will be all right.  
"Here I am, father," she said.  
I'm too happy to care.  
"Poor Polly," said the Doctor.  
Here Maggie approached the store-room door.  
"I know I shall be sorry.  
"No, Miss, I'm sure I don't.  
"Not experienced, indeed!  
Can you make the oven hot?  
Why, it's quite wonderful!  
Poll, dear, what is the matter?  
You both look full of business."  
"It is not that," said Polly.  
Do, do, do say 'yes,' darling Poll."  
"Outlandish--most outlandish!"  
"But you remind me of her.  
And please lay supper in the dining-room.  
Helen smothered a slight sigh.  
Why did not Polly come in?  
Where were Katie and the twins?  
I have come to see baby.  
"We call them Bob and Bunny."  
"Utterly ridiculous!  
said Helen, in her most reproachful tones.  
Oh, there is just one thing more.  
"Only this, Aunt Maria.  
Oh, for Monday to arrive!  
"Lucy, darling," said Helen.  
Say it slowly after me."  
Welcome to Sleepy Hollow.  
How did you find the children?"  
"I cannot tell you, Andrew.  
"Then I will join you in the dining-room."  
let me kiss you once again.  
Bunny, you can tell that part."  
"You are a mean girl," she said.  
He seems to be mighty wise.  
"I'll be back at nine o'clock.  
"But not in your arms, father.  
she said--"your wife's sister."  
"I hope not," said the Doctor.  
She behaved badly, I grant.  
"How queerly you look at me, Andrew.  
What is the matter, Andrew?"  
"She is never to come here.  
She is never to come here.  
"What a darling father is!  
"She is lovely," said Polly.  
Dr. Maybright stroked back Polly's curls.  
Come here, and sit on my lap.  
"I'll stay below," said David.  
Who's the jolliest here?  
Couldn't we have a game of ball?  
I haven't played ball since I left Ballarat.  
I want my tea, if you don't."  
Yes, of course, I'm starving."  
Children, please don't stare so hard."  
"Come and have tea," said Helen.  
That was before I knew you.  
she repeated, earnestly.  
"I spoke to him," said Flower.  
"We are here on sufferance, that's all.  
"I didn't speak of them," she said.  
"But Polly is nice," interposed David.  
"Let's have Maggie," she said.  
"A kitchen-maid's only a servant."  
"How extraordinary!"  
She looked over her shoulder.  
"But it isn't that," said David.  
I'm rather hot myself.  
I wish to be by myself.  
David moved away slowly.  
"What is the matter, my lad?"  
What is the best way to walk?  
The house felt still and restful.  
"She takes to Polly, does she?"  
"Now, baby, come on," she said.  
"Sure-_ly_," he responded back to her.  
"I said as it wor a hut.  
Bring me some food out here, please.  
"It's soup I'm arter.  
Suddenly she raised her head.  
"'Tis a bonny babe," she said.  
Give her your own soup, Patrick."  
What is the matter, woman?  
"Why, mother, what's took you?  
"No, you won't," said the woman.  
I'm ready; let's go."  
"Oh, you are a cry-baby," said Polly.  
"What a queer boy David is!"  
Don't take on so, Miss Polly!  
Why, your looks fairly scare me."  
"This is no time for feelings.  
"How long ago is that, Nurse?"  
Where's Nell, where are the twins?"  
I'll come back when I've found them.  
You has no call to talk so.  
Oh, how fearsome is this moor!  
Her voice neither rose nor fell.  
"Oh, what a darling you are!  
Take the baby, and let me."  
Why, you ain't very handy!  
"And the bogey in Deadman's Glen.  
Why did mother go away?  
Why did I want her to come?  
she must put up with Maggie.  
See, it is twisted all round.  
I once strained my foot like that.  
I don't want to speak of it.  
I cannot possibly stir.  
Do run, Flower; do be quick.  
"I shan't be long," said Flower.  
"I wish she would let me in.  
she asked, her voice trembling.  
Give her to me this moment.  
Give me baby this moment.  
"Are you going to stay here?  
If you are, I'll go away."  
Into this now Flower sank.  
"There's bread on the sideboard," said Fly.  
"I'm sorry you're starving.  
"Give me that bread," said Flower.  
she said in a cold though broken-hearted voice.  
"I'm better now," she said.  
What do you accuse me of?"  
"What horrid things you say, child!  
Father was out all last night.  
"What's the matter, Flower?  
"She's in father's room."  
"Is baby very ill, too?"  
Don't you want something to eat?"  
Flower went back to her room.  
Still all this mattered nothing.  
"Yes, Miss, the Doctor's despert bad."  
I was out later last night."  
"I'm hot; I'm burning.  
"I don't know, I'm sure, Miss."  
"But you can sell the diamond.  
I am not a bit surprised.  
but they'll fret to part with you."  
Where does the carrier live?"  
It might, if you condescended to third class."  
"Third class will do very well.  
"I wouldn't, Miss, if I was you."  
"Yes, you would if you were me.  
I see you know it quite well."  
Flower started to her feet.  
We haven't a minute to spare.  
She is coming already!  
"There, my love, do you hear her?  
Now, what is it you are called?  
May I tell you my story?"  
"I don't know; I don't think so.  
what is the world coming to?  
What have you come to me for?"  
How should she find the Doctor?  
"Is that _you_, Aunt Maria?"  
When would the doctors come out?  
We feared mischief to the brain.  
Good-by, children; keep up your spirits.  
"What are we to say, Polly?"  
"Yes, if you want to have me.  
she said, and she stamped her foot.  
"The hole isn't here," said David.  
"You haven't made the hole there, Dave?"  
"Yes, I have, in one corner!  
"Now, then, master, here you go!  
Her eyes were red with weeping.  
murmured Fly, almost aloud.  
exclaimed Mrs. Cameron.  
"Well, really, that _is_ too much.  
"I've done it all now," he said.  
"But it was so true, David.  
"Oh, Dave, how could you take it!"  
I exonerate David.  
"I think you are doing wrong!"  
Mrs. Cameron shuddered.  
Polly, I begin with you."  
"Firefly, what do you know?"  
No Polly was in the room.  
His fingers closed over them.  
How these small fingers flutter!  
"As a dragon," said Polly.  
Tell me, has David confessed?"  
She still lay flat on the ground.  
One of the minutes flew by.  
Let me go to the house, ma'am.  
"Pardon me, my good woman.  
We won't be disturbed in here.  
"Yes, I am quite strong enough.  
I am accustomed to them."  
"Helen, here's a letter."  
"I think it's for us all.  
"As if I didn't know it, Nell!  
"Father thinks so much of her.  
"Your Father and loving Friend."  
"Oh, I can't talk about it.  
And then they kissed each other.

"What was she so glad about?"

"Sure I've not seen _you_ before?"  
asked Phil, with an amused smile.  
"Then w'y don't you say what you mean?  
"And what have you got there, Pax?"  
DOWNWARD--DEEPER AND DEEPER.  
"Wot asylum 'ave _you_ escaped

He could think of nothing else.  
"You are surprised to see me, Tottie?"  
"You put it in the pillar?"  
"What a wretched spectacle!"  
roared the voice in rising wrath.  
"Yes, didn't the doctor tell you?  
There's a dear fellow--come."  
"Very well, sir, w'en shall I call?"  
come here," cried the repentant shopman.  
"Who trusted you with half a sov?"  
"Then why did she send you here?"  
There was no resisting this.  
Here's a high stool for you.  
He looked round him in dismay.  
"Your pheasant, my good woman?"  
demanded the virago.  
"Now, Mr Aspel, I'll relieve you.  
By the _way_, have you a  
home?"  
"Hire a little boy," said Aspel.  
"Sure, ye can explain," said Phil.  
Their patience was  
rewarded.  
I shall make inquiries.  
I shall see to this at once."  
The  
little stars reappeared.  
So she gave 'im to me to nuss.  
"Yes, sir; I've got both of 'em.  
I'm so miserable.  
"Thank the Lord for _that_, Molly.  
I can scarce tell  
what it was.  
I wonder what causes this?"  
Then, again--"  

"O Mr Flint!  
Well, that gives 660 millions of words.  
We do not say this to her disparagement.

Can nothing be done for her?"

"There; I've got him in all right.  
"Now, guv'nor, I'm at your sarvice," he said.

"It is quite illegible."  
"You were right," responded Miss Lillycrop.  
"As for a meeting-room, wouldn't  
this do?  
For second offences--a woppin' and a fine.  
"Too fond of punning," objected Phil.  
"Can't say; not yet decided."

"What a wretched spectacle!"  
"Yes, Molly, I promise that."  
"What's the address, Abel?"  
Now,

she cried, looking brightly up.  
There is no mistaking it.  
There was a bridge just

Bones followed furiously.  
he said, in a gruff

She began with the cellars.  
she asked, in a low whisper.  
"Rats," said Miss Stivergill in a low voice.  
I _do_ hope so," whispered Miss Lillycrop.  
"Are you sure it was  
Cat Street?"  
"No, sir, I don't think it could.  
"Let us visit the boiler-house," he said.  
Phil therefore searched the Scripture.  
They've muckle to answer for."  
It was repeated four times.

and returned to their old haunts.  
We've got plenty of 'em at 'ome.  
Bones followed his example.  
"A good many," answered the colporteur.  
"Have you another copy?"  
You remember that, surely?  
Fortunately she was light.  
THE GREATEST BATTLE OF ALL.  
So did I," said Mr Blurt.  
"I'm in earnest, mother."  
As it is, the die is cast.  
Mrs Maylands wisely submitted.  
"I would think it nonsense, Phil."  
he merely telegraphs the word `_Hamlet_.'

DOCTOR GRAYSON'S THEORY.  
"And I'm sure you are wrong.  
I shall make him a statesman."  
said Lady Danby, smiling.  
said her ladyship as a howl arose.  
"Enjoyed your evening, my dear?"  
"Boys, sir; the house swarms with them."  
"I see, sir," said the master.  
"Go back, Bunce," cried the master.  
"To be sure," said the doctor.  
Constantly being punished."  
"Say _sir_, boy," cried the master.  
Don't chatter so," said Mr Sibery reprovingly.  
"Yes; I think he may, Mr Hippetts?"  
"I am satisfied, Mr Hippetts."  
Now, my man, are you ready?"  
"Shall I send the boy on, sir?"  
"Thanks, no, Hippetts; I'll take him with me."  
Run on, boy, and we'll follow."  
"None, sir, as far as we know.  
The very boy I wanted.  
The worst boy in the whole school."  
"No, you will have your meals here."  
cried the boy excitedly.  
Where's the dormitory?  
"Would you like a piece of cake!"  
"Oh no; she's the servant."  
Now, then, what's the first thing?  
"Oh yes; at once," said Helen.  
Now, what's to be done first?  
You must feed him up, Helen."  
"What did you say your name was!"  
Throw them out of that window."  
"All right: Dexter Coleby," said the boy.  
cried the doctor testily.  
"I see you are teachable.  
"Now, then," said the doctor, "clothes.  
"I say, will that chap be long?"  
"I should like to read to you.  
I cannot stand any more.  
"Ah, yes, lunch," said the doctor.  
"Go and put them directly."  
said the doctor quietly.  
"Then may I send you some lamb!"  
"Oh yes, Dexter," said Helen.  
"You have neither bread nor salt."  
But it was hard work for him.  
But it was an accident."  
Well, sir, how do you feel now!"  
"Yes, that's it," said Dexter.  
No, thankye," cried Dexter eagerly.  
"That's right, but don't say _she_.  
"And I've got three pairs of boots.  
"I say, mayn't I go with you?"  
"I say," cried Dexter loudly.  
said the doctor, looking up.  
"Go on looking at your book."  
"That damages the bindings.  
"On that chair, sir," said Dexter confusedly.  
Bless me, I thought he was here!"  
But Dan'l Copestake said it was all nonsense.  
"Oh, do stop him," cried Helen.  
So it was with scores of things.  
said Peter, in a whisper.  
I could about feel it, like."  
"Good job too, I says," grumbled Dan'l.  
"Nay, we don't want no fruit-ladders," grumbled Dan'l.  
"We'll soon fetch his lordship down.  
"Are you over there, Peter?"  
"Oh, that's your game, is it!"  
"Oh, that's your game, is it!"  
"I couldn't help it," said Dexter.  
cried the doctor angrily.  
said Dexter indignantly.  
"Keep still; there's a good boy."  
Looks like a young invalid."  
DEXTER IS VERY SORRY.  
"Are you going to cane me?"  
"I am so precious hungry."  
"Now you are laughing at me."  
You had better write that book."  
I think he is," assented the doctor.  
"Going back again," he said hoarsely.  
I will ring when we want them."  
"That lady--Lady Danby!"  
"But is it a funny word!"  
"No; but I could at a boy.  
I'd ha' given him such a oner.  
"But why throw at the poor bird?  
"You didn't see me throw at them?"  
"My windows easily break."  
"A mischievous young rascal!"  
"Wrong this time," said the Vicar good-humouredly.  
"Sure of it, sir; sure of it."  
no, sir; decidedly not.  
"We'll buy one as we go back.  
"Don't you be afraid of them.  
The effect was magical.  
"That's the way to serve them.  
Oh, look at that butterfly!  
"Could you do that now, Dexter!"  
"I should say he was a beast."  
What are you going to do!"  
"You are not cross with me now!"  
"Here's something the matter!"  
"You shouldn't be afraid o' them."  
"I'll see as they don't hurt you."  
"No, no; you can't," cried the boy.  
"He ain't," said Dexter sharply.  
"Do you feel hurt anywhere?"  
He shook hands warmly with both.  
"Good day, Miss Grayson, and thanks."  
"What is the matter, Dexter?"  
You were very brave indeed."  
What, now the danger is past?"  
But you're sure he won't be cross?"  
"And I would not suck the pen.  
"Mr Dengate, sir," said Maria.  
What does he want, Maria?  
The doctor said, "Send him in."  
"I say, who is old Billy?"  
It's what my boy won't do.  
said the doctor testily.  
Why, a child would make 'em run.  
"What are you going to do!"  
Morning, young--er--gentleman.  
"And when may I go fishing?"  
But I want a rod and line."  
Dan'l did not need much looking for.  
"Ay, you're right; they are," grumbled Dan'l.  
Oh, I see, thou'rt going fishing.  
"Yes, if I can get some worms."  
There, you've got another bite.  
"But I want to get it out."  
cried the boy excitedly.  
You should strike gently, like that."  
"Ever see grandfather there!"  
"That's the way," shouted Bob Dimsted.  
"Look sharp, they're biting like fun."  
Yes; half a dozen on yer.  
"Why, then, I should lose the fish."  
"Wait till I get out my knife."  
"THEM AS IS BORN TO BE HANGED."  
Bob Dimsted did nothing of the kind.  
"But I must get my fish, sir."  
Groom waiting for an answer."  
"May I say a word, papa!"  
"Certainly, my dear; of course."  
She knew the smell of boiled soap.  
"The things are completely spoiled.  
"Ask him to let me stop here."  
"No, no," said Helen kindly.  
"Don't say chap, Dexter; say boy."  
"Not by yourselves, I suppose.  
Dexter shook his head again.  
"I say, you'll come too, won't you?"  
"And how soon may I come back?"  
"Dersay you could, if you could hold on."  
Let me go with you next time!"  
Young gents don't get up till eight."  
I say, let me go with you."  
he said; "what's the matter!"  
"What was you doing to 'em, Dan'l!"  
"Nay, I'm not coming," growled Dan'l.  
"Ain't you going in with me!"  
"No; I think not," said Sir James.  
"Now, then, shake hands with your friend."  
"That's better," said Sir James.  
"No, pa," said Edgar slowly.  
"Why are you hesitating?  
You two will soon be good friends."  
"I say, don't you fish sometimes!"  
Dexter started, and stared hard.  
"I don't want to, if you don't."  
"Did you hear me say, `Get up'?"  
This last was beyond bearing.  
"What is the meaning of this!"  
cried Sir James furiously.  
cried Dexter indignantly.  
"O my darling, my darling!"  
I know: you've been climbing trees.  
You'll ketch it, spoiling your clothes.  
Caught any down your garden!"  
continued Helen sternly.  
"Fighting," said Dexter grimly.  
"There, Dexter," she said at last.  
"I wish you to come, Dexter."  
"So you are there, are you, sir?"  
"Oh, that's all, is it, sir!"  
"That will do," said the doctor.  
"Certainly," said the doctor.  
"What do you think he told me?"  
now you are laughing at me.  
"And what did you say, papa?"  
Dreadful young limb that Edgar.  
Helen shook her head sadly.  
But there: we must persevere.  
"Ah, well; I did not mean it.  
"What are you doing, Dexter!"  
"Come in, sir," cried the doctor.  
Either he goes or I do.  
Just as if you did not know!  
I said you might have some fruit."  
"Apples is fruit," said Dexter.  
"Apples _are_ fruit," said Dexter.  
cried the doctor angrily.  
"Please, sir, I didn't," cried Dexter.  
"Then what am I to do, sir?  
cried Dexter excitedly.  
I know what he wants to do.  
THE BEGINNING OF TROUBLE.  
"What have I been doing now!"  
"I hope nothing fresh, Dexter.  
"No," said Dexter eagerly.  
"I thought they were two people.  
Dexter's eyes grew more round.  
"I'm going to, some day.  
said Dexter innocently.  
"But suppose the sun didn't shine!"  
"You couldn't have that," cried Dexter.  
"Why, I could fight yer one hand."  
"And what'll you do for a sail?"  
My, what fishing I shall have!"  
said Dexter, after a time.  
Some chaps would be glad to go."  
said Bob, with a mocking laugh.  
"I might take you, and I mightn't.  
"I'm as strong as you are."  
"Yes, I know'd you wouldn't go, so.  
"Oh yes, I could if I liked."  
I know what you came there for.  
THE PLEASANT WAYS OF LEARNING.  
I shall never learn Euclid.  
"I can't, sir, please," sighed the boy.  
"Was there ever such a boy?  
"I--I--"  "Don't hesitate, sir.  
exclaimed the tutor sharply.  
This is very serious.  
By no means," said the doctor.  
said Helen, for the boy paused.  
"Have you been out to meet him?"  
"No, that I haven't," cried Dexter.  
"Then why don't you try harder?"  
Algebra is beyond me."  
"Certainly I will, Dexter."  
Now what could you do with oats?"  
"Yes; that's what Mr Limpney said.  
"Try another way, Dexter."  
"No, Maria, I did not.  
she said, looking round sharply.  
"No gammon, you know," said Bob.  
"No, not quite--yet," said Dexter.  
"Why, we might go now--easy."  
"And p'r'aps that won't be long enough.  
I mean just before you come."  
"Can't you see where it fell in!"  
"It seems to know," cried Dexter.  
how did I find out, indeed!  
"They certainly ought to know."  
Dexter gazed at her wildly.  
"Yes," said Dexter dismally.  
Kill them with kindness, you know.  
It'll take two to get that boat."  
"Come across," said Bob coolly.  
"But it's too deep to wade."  
I'm undressing as fast as I can.  
"I'm coming," said Dexter.  
"I don't want to get them wet."  
cried Dexter excitedly.  
"I wish I'd brought a towel."  
"Why, you ain't swimming," said Bob.  
I'd do it in a minute.  
"I can't," said Dexter sadly.  
"We must try some other way.  
They're floating down the river."  
"But you swam over," said Bob sneeringly.  
don't make a row," whispered Bob.  
"Now then, slip in and fetch it.  
Why, you could almost jump it."  
"But suppose the chains are locked!"  
"How much money have you got?"  
"And you call yourself a mate?"  
"Why don't yer mind and keep time!"  
Look here, do you want to fight?  
"I only said it wasn't me."  
Bob was quiet after that.  
"Well, nobody asked you to.  
I haven't got a watch, have I?  
D'yer want them to come and ketch us!"  
"Yes, you're a nice fellow to wantcher bragfuss.  
Got no money and no clothes.  
I s'pose I shall have to keep yer."  
"Bread and cheese," faltered Dexter.  
Talk about a place for a bragfuss!  
Why, it would do to live in."  
"I don't want no more than half."  
Going to have any more?"  
We borrowed it together."  
"Can't do everything at once."  
Fetch 'em back," cried the keeper.  
Well, do you want me to go?  
Dexter's horror increased.  
"Then why did you run away?"  
"'Cause I didn't want no bother.  
"Don't be afraid," said Dexter.  
"Going to catch some more fish!"  
"I shall fish all along here."  
They're so jolly hard to hold."  
Wait a bit and I'll show yer.  
I ain't going to kill 'em."  
"But you won't roast them alive."  
"But you might have killed them first."  
"How was I to kill 'em first?"  
"Wait a bit and I'll show you.  
said Dexter excitedly.  
"You haven't been to sleep, have you!"  
"Have a cup of warm coffee?"  
"Kitch holt o' that scull and pull.  
"I'm a fisherman too."  
I'll give you a pound for her."  
"We mustn't sell her, Bob," he said.  
"Not a pound and the boat too."  
you're always sleepy," said Bob.  
"So you will have to again."  
"It's your turn to watch now."  
"Here, I say, wake up," he cried.  
Whatcher been and done with that there boat!"  
"Fastened up to that old tree."  
"I should like to see it, then.  
"But which way shall I go, Bob?  
"I never see such a chap!"  
I dunno, and I don't care.  
This was a startling question.  
Say we ain't no right to it.  
"But p'r'aps it's floating about?"  
Why should I come and help yer?  
"Now then," he said; "get on, d'yer hear?  
"You've got to find that there boat."  
cried Dexter excitedly.  
"Come arter us and stole it!"  
I'll just let him know--a thief.  
"But s'pose he won't give it to us!"  
"No; he must have thrown them out.  
We know where the boat is now!"  
"No, he won't," whispered Dexter.  
"Look out, Bob," shouted Dexter.  
"I've got yer now, have I, then?"  
"Let's leave the boat and run."  
There, I can see the river.  
Hurray, Bob, we're nearly there!"  
"I hit him right on the head."  
"I couldn't help it," said Dexter huskily.  
I don't think I shall go back.  
THE CROWNING POINT OF THE TRIP.  
"I wish I was safe at home."  
"It's of no use, matey.  
Bob mocked at the idea.  
I say, are you nearly dry?"  
"But suppose the boat should sink?"  
"There, I shan't go to sleep yet.  
"That I'm sure I will not."  
cried Dexter excitedly.  
He'll be tired out by then."  
"May I ask you what you mean?"  
cried the doctor stubbornly.  
He would have sent the boat back."  
I would try and reform him."  
said Peter, "matter enough.  
"Going to run away, eh!"  
"Now, you give in," he whispered.  
"Y'ain't no business to stop me here."  
"And y'ain't no business to stop me.  
cried Bob volubly; "me steal your boat, sir?  
"And you sent it by this boy?"  
I never had no money."  
ejaculated Bob, with an astonished look.  
"Now, sir, where's that money?"  
"I never see no letter."  
"No," said the doctor shortly.  
"Really," said Sir James, laughing.  
"Yer needn't look like that," he said.  
"It was all his fault," he said sullenly.  
"I say, Dan'l, you wouldn't mind, would you?"  
"Giving me one of the noo brooms.  
"It'll be him, and serve him right."  
"Not it," continued Peter.  
You'll get it, my gentleman!"  
"I never see no money.  
"Well done, young un," cried Peter delightedly.  
"Here, you let me get at him!"  
The task was very easy.  
Let me get at him," shrieked Bob.  
"Yes, let him go, Dan'l," cried Peter.  
"Yes, sir," said Dexter sadly.  
I sent word we were coming."  
"No, no," said Dexter quickly.  
"I can tell you," said Helen.  
"But you will not be laughed at."  
"Indeed, my dear, but I shall.  
"You're a witch, my dear," he said.  
cried the doctor testily.  
"No, no, no," said the doctor cheerily.  
Fish here as long as I like.  
Fight either of yer one hand."  
go on with your old brickbats.  
Come as often as I like.  
"Ay, if you like, my lad," said Dan'l.  
Dexter gave him a sharp look.  
said the doctor angrily.  
the skin's off your knuckles.  
"Down the garden," said Helen.  
cried the doctor testily.  
ejaculated the doctor, at intervals.  
"Yes: a very great mistake."  
I'll write to Mr Mastrum at once.  
The doctor sat down and wrote.  
"When is he to go, papa?"  
"So you're going off, are yer!"  
"They don't flog boys at good schools."  
cried Dexter excitedly.  
"This is very strange, Millett.  
"Do not condemn him unheard."  
"Do you think he will come back!"  
"I don't know," said the doctor.  
"Why, you white-faced, cowardly noodle!"  
"Well, then, my lad, I'll tell you.  
"Where did you see it, Peter?"  
said the doctor angrily.  
Peter went on in advance.  
"It has no business to be.  
A STARTLING DISCOVERY.  
Here, Peter, hand me the gun!"  
"Will you come down quietly?"  
There was another murmur.  
"Oh, you have nothing to say!  
he said; "the boy has fainted."  
"Yes," he said softly, "fever.  
"Get out," said Dan'l, some weeks later.  
"Old Dan'l gets too bad to live with.  
"They're gone," he said gleefully.  
"Why didn't you feed the poor thing?"  
You understand what I mean."  
But come and have a look round.  
Well, well, I suppose we must."  
she said, again and again.

he resumed his weary march.  
Okiok is no longer what he was.  
His words I understand not.  
"And his dress--how does he dress?"  
"Why did you not bring him here?"  
He was not left long in doubt.  
asked the seaman anxiously.  
asked Okiok, after a brief silence.  
Do you not know that Angut wants her?"  
The poor creature did not rise.  
But he did not try to sleep.  
He never told any one.  
"Never; at least not often."  
There never was an angekok like him."  
Do I not speak what is true?"  
This  
familiar is styled his "torngak."  
said Ujarak, glad to change the subject.  
"Yes; I killed it yesterday.  
Nevertheless I will eat.  
returned the other meekly.  
"I should like to hear him speak."  
Can you spare her for that work?"  
They understood each  
other.  
"Not at all, stupid puffin!  
He could  
not stand before that.  
"Quite sure," replied the wizard.  
"Do you want to grow fatter?"  
"The words of Ujarak are wise," he said.  
Let us go out to the hunt."  
By all means let  
him have it.  
It's like yourself--tender."  
"Like the summer-houses of the Innuit, I suppose?"  
There are none but safe tongues  
here.  
I cannot understand  
them."  
TREATS OF CROSS-PURPOSES AND DIFFICULTIES.  
Ippegoo let fly hastily, and missed.  
"Have the hunters found no seals?"  
"No; Ippegoo must come with me," he said.  
"I have work for him to do.  
But he shall never get her!  
There you will find me with two sledges.  
We will live there for ever.  
"What did he tell you to do?"  
"Who shall I invite, mother?"  
exclaimed Pussimek, with a `huk' of surprise!  
a miserable country!"  
He  
could only glare and pant.  
"Yes, mother, I can explain.  
We would all like to know that."  
"And broad," observed another.  
Use your eyes and bite your tongues.  
But  
the wink had been observed.  
This was too much for Rooney.  
"They are easily frightened.  
Come, I  
will explain to you.  
you worse than baby walrus!"  
"Yet his conduct  
does seem strange.  
What has  
brought you back so soon?  
you exclaim, "what a question!  
he asked softly, looking round.  
"How can a man eat too much?"  
In a few minutes Okiok returned.  
what is Tumbler putting on?"  
he asked in  
astonishment.  
asked Nuna, as she stirred  
her kettle.  
"These two are always plotting.  
He was my grandmother's.  
"How, then, are quarrels settled?"  
Angut looked puzzled--as well he might!  
But they do not always kill.  
"Is it then the wounded one?"  
"With what are they satisfied?"  
"That's more than I can tell, Angut.  
The two men paused to listen.  
asked Pussi, in a voice of alarm.  
It was suddenly broken.  
We came  
to a small hummock of ice.  
It was rugged and  
broken.  
The wizard paused, and looked round.  
Did you  
ever see me run?"  
My feelings became dreadful.  
They took the poor  
Kablunet to their house.  
"Go on," they cried; "tell us more."  
"That is true," replied Okiok humbly.  
It was the voice of Conscience.  
Ippegoo hesitated a moment.  
"Of course you are, foolish man.  
"_You_ know, my dear little seal?"  
asked his mother tenderly.  
The goodwife was busy over the cooking-lamp.  
"Visiting the mother of Arbalik."  
asked Rooney of the young girl.  
It is a great mystery."  
"I guess his reason," he said.  
"Yes; what may it be, think you?"  
"Well, where is that bear's skin?"  
But Ujarak was inexorable.  
I'll be disgraced  
forever."  
Don't forget your drum and the  
face-making.  
You know what you've got to do?"  
He tried his best to have it.  
"O why won't you come to me, torngak?"  
"It is very cold  
outside.  
Nor shall you ever have a  
torngak.  
This assembly must break up.  
asked Rooney,  
after Ippegoo had left.  
"I will stop that," said Rooney.  
Come with me to the hut of Ujarak."  
It seemed so  
unnatural.  
"Who told you to tell her that?"  
Simek ran out to meet them.  
Angut was roused to desperation.  
They want iron very much.  
They will be glad to see you.  
The dreadful  
jaws were open.  
It is well that I should die."  
shouted Okiok, as the lads pushed off.  
That is beyond my knowledge.  
"Then why does evil exist?"  
It is to  
cure, to relieve."  
And He will prove it some day.  
"Neither do I," said Simek.  
Red Rooney felt ill at ease.  
"Everything is mystery.  
He cannot be otherwise.  
I look  
around, and I see.  
"Halo, Ippe, what's wrong with you?"  
asked Rooney on entering.  
"What will you attack it with?"  
"He knows it well enough," said Ermigit.  
But this berg is very deep.  
A  
fasting man should not talk."  
"You--you--forgive me, I _see_?"  
I thank God for sending you.  
I have been taught to trust Him."  
"What's your name, you walrus?"  
It is too full already."  
"Run, Arbalik, Ippegoo, Ermigit, Norrak, and seek  
for the kayak."  
"He may give you some trouble."  
No such fear affected Hans Egede.  
Then he thundered forth--  

"Never!  
The wife of Mangek was my dear child.  
But  
why does he spit it out?  
Her duty was to obey.  
"Then why did God permit sin?"  
and what will come after it?  
I  
wait for enlightenment."  
With an energetic "humph!"  
Yet you have never seen it.  
You know when the life is there.  
Does it  
therefore not exist?  
you say your  
soul is healthy.  
"No; drowning is far too good.  
We must not act like devils.  
"Truly, that is so," answered Egede.  
This is no fanciful speech.  
"I am sure she is a witch.  
"But what if they _don't_ come here?"  
"Too good to hope for," murmured Arbalik.  
shouted Rooney in her ear.  
It went deep  
and was well aimed.  
"My son, what is the matter?"  
"Mother, my heart is heavy.  
The poor youth was comforted.

Never mind, I'll do it yet."  
"Just like him," said Reginald.  
What ages ago that seemed!  
A porter opened the door.  
"These are your sons, I presume?"  
"Oh, mother, do forgive me!  
"I wonder who's coming."  
"Any more about them, ma?"  
The boys' room was equally cheerless.  
However is Reg to shave?"  
"But who are your letters from?"  
What are you going to do?  
No boys wanted; we're full up."  
"What do you mean by believe?  
"I'm not used to printing."  
"No," said Mr Durfy, scornfully, "I guessed not.  
"Open the window, do you 'ear?  
Do try it, old man, won't you?"  
"Where are we to get it from?"  
said Horace, laughing again.  
I'm sick of hearing it.  
it's enough to choke one."  
Reginald's spirits fell.  
said the horrified mother.  
"Pray take a seat," said Mrs Cruden.  
And 'ow do you do, too, my man?"  
said she, addressing Horace.  
And my 'usband's name, Mrs Cruden, was 'Oward.  
"Not much of a berth, is it?"  
So you haven't got an album?"  
"I--I didn't mean to be rude."  
Horace could not help laughing.  
"Didn't I tell you to shut up?"  
"I should think so," said Horace.  
Send him at once, Durfy, do you hear?"  
"I've been waiting here ten-minutes for you."  
A boy answered the summons.  
"What are you standing there for?"  
Now we're ready to start you.  
Let me see what you have done."  
"Yes, and I hear you're both fools.  
said the manager, sharply.  
Booms will stand first, won't you, Booms?"  
if I _had_ forgotten it!"  
I've tried it a dozen times.  
I'm not damaged a bit."  
Not even a broken leg!  
"You'd better go home now, young 'un."  
Still Reginald was honest.  
I don't wonder you think so."  
"I'm afraid I can't," said Gedge.  
Reginald made no reply.  
Nor was he disappointed.  
"How are you, Mr Medlock?"  
Gone in love, I suppose, eh?  
"I'm very sorry," said Durfy.  
What's your little game now?"  
"I'll try and manage that," said Durfy.  
Do you think _you'd_ suit the place?"  
asked the former, with a laugh.  
There, what do you think of that?  
No, I didn't show it to you.  
But Horace dissuaded him.  
"Apply confidentially."  
"Omega"--that sounded well!  
The day flew on leaden wings.  
There it was, not a bit changed!  
It's only nine o'clock.  
Very neighbourly it was.  
Whisper, `Dog,' that's your word."  
"I say, Cruden, please don't mention--_her_."  
do _you_ play the piano?"  
Mr Cruden plays the piano!  
What a piano it was!  
Perhaps Miss Shuckleford--"  "Yes, Jim, you play.  
SAID THE SPIDER TO THE FLY.  
"Mr Cruden, sir," said the waiter.  
"Yes," said he, "450--a lot, isn't it?  
Very sad to think of it."  
The boy's face fell sadly.  
I don't think you could, myself.  
I'm afraid you'll be late."  
I shall go to please myself.  
"We can do without you here.  
"Yes; I'm afraid it does.  
"Do you know any of them?"  
"Mr Medlock thought you might."  
"What will you do about the 50?"  
"Hullo, Cruden, you've turned up then," said Blandford.  
I don't think I shall either."  
asked Reginald wistfully.  
said Blandford to the latter.  
"Where's your brother living?"  
Reginald rounded on him.  
"What shall we do without you?"  
How often are the classes?"  
"Well, as often as we like.  
Generally once a week.  
You think so too, don't you, Booms?"  
We never mention it, though."  
Don't forget, there's a brick.  
How's Harker, by the way?"  
Blandford and Pillans exchanged glances.  
He said you'd know about it.  
A debt's a debt, you know."  
"No, that won't do," said Horace.  
Horace fired up fiercely.  
"Take that for an impudent young beggar!"  
Let's hear all about it.  
till I take it out of him."  
He was asking after you."  
Of course he does," said Horace.  
He and Blandford--  Ah, Blandford!  
"Has he left any message?"  
He could not understand it.  
The meal was a dismal one.  
It will have to be altered."  
"'Undreds of grillions on 'em," replied the boy.  
Strange to say, the boy obeyed.  
"No, sir; you called me Mr Cruden."  
said Mr Medlock, laughing.  
capital sherry, this brand.  
"No one has called, I suppose?"  
"All right," said Mr Medlock.  
said Reginald angrily.  
"Once or twice Durfy broke the silence.  
"`So are we,' said Waterford.  
This was getting critical.  
No, sir, my name's Wrigley!"  
It won't do, I can tell you."  
"Then why don't you send the things?"  
"I know that, young man," said she.  
I _knew_ it was a swindle!  
"That is my name," replied he.  
"Could I--can you show me one?"  
I did so want to get one."  
It will save carriage, you know."  
"Oh, well, thank you very much.  
It must be hard work for you."  
"No, they are in London too."  
"That really seems moderate.  
SAMUEL SHUCKLEFORD FINDS HIMSELF BUSY.  
"What do you know about it?  
You'd better draw off a bit."  
"No," said the mother warmly.  
You're not equal to it now.  
I'm dead on you this time.  
"No, but I'm introduced."  
I'll look at it afterwards."  
I kicked him out long ago.  
Sit down, and don't be afraid."  
"Who have you done for this time?"  
"That there Medlock," said the boy.  
What _are_ you talking about?"  
Was it genuine or not?  
He could see it all at last.  
"No, my boy," said Reginald.  
He did not like it at all.  
He might have accomplices.  
I've told him where to find us.  
Mr Shanklin laughed again.  
"Oh yes, I took care of that.  
"I'm going, for all that."  
"Forget what it was about.  
"Fifty," said Mr Shanklin.  
"Good-night--old--feller," said he; "see you to-morrow."  
"Capital fellow is Bland."  
he was getting near it now.  
"He did, if you want to know."  
"Go it; say on," said Samuel.  
Her mother could do nothing.  
"So I am," said Jemima.  
"Something I've done, I suppose?"  
It's about--about the Crudens."  
I hate secrets, but go on."  
"Oh yes, I'll try, if you like."  
"You call yourself Cruden Reginald?"  
I've murdered dozens, do you 'ear?  
"I'll do for yer if you don't.  
Have you made your entries, Jones?  
Some one else whistled softly.  
"Ten- minutes will do this case."  
Then he found himself alone.  
"You reserve your defence, then?"  
It was all too real this time.  
It's a clear case, isn't it?"  
"Ninepence, please," said the rosy-cheeked girl who waited.  
Let them mock him; what cared he?  
The great river lay asleep.  
"Now then, sheer off; do you hear?"  
"Why, Love, is that you, my boy?"  
"What made you think I would come?"  
Leastways unless you was a-goin' to commit soosanside.  
What are you talking about?"  
No fear, I ain't forgot it.  
"There's one there already.  
He must stay where he was now.  
"Any news from Liverpool?"  
he inquired eagerly.  
"Well, then, is anything wrong?  
"His mother is ill," said he.  
"Somebody must, poor fellow!"  
It's about Reginald.  
"I have, plenty for us both.  
I can't believe it of Reg.  
"Has the case of Cruden come on yet?"  
But no one was at Shy Street.  
"How could he with no money?"  
And he was bad when he came.  
"Did any doctor see him?"  
How I wish I had some food!"  
How circumstances change us!  
Besides, who'd look after you?"  
"He won't die--he shall not die!"  
Mr Pilch laughed quietly.  
He may last a day or two.  
No use my coming again.  
"I daresay you could find out.  
Things were just then at their worst.  
"I do hope he will take it.  
They are--"  "Hullo, there's the postman!"  
Horace, however, stopped her.  
said--or rather roared--Horace.

She was not a pretty child.  
If I were you, I should try.  
She keeps it all in her heart."  
said the poor child, trembling.  
I'm covered with mud now.  
"You are nothing but a doll!"  
Sara bent and picked her up.  
"What is the matter with you?"  
she asked her, perhaps rather disdainfully.  
"What is the matter with you?"  
"I want your books--I want them."  
"That you can't learn things quickly.  
"I believe you've forgotten."  
Sara made a little bow.  
"Haven't you had any dinner?"  
Never got nothin' to-day--nowhere.  
"In the gutter," said Sara.  
"Keep it, then," said the woman.  
"Do you want to buy something?"  
The woman thought it over.  
I wish I could speak to the Lascar.  
I remember a little Hindustani."  
"Where have you wasted your time?"  
"You have been out for hours!"  
"May I have something to eat?"  
Sara asked rather faintly.  
Sara went and found the bread.  
It was old and hard and dry.  
I know, I know it isn't true!"  
"Don't stand there staring at them."  
Sara did as she was told.  
Please let me say just these words.  
said Sara, caressing him.  
"I live at Miss Minchin's."  
"Well, what has happened since then?"  
"My papa died," said Sara.  
"That is about it, isn't it?"  
"I belong to nobody."  
He trusted his friend too much."  
Tell me your father's name."  
It turned out well after all.  
He was a fine young fellow.  
He seemed to know what to do.  
"Tell him to come here at once.  
Tell him I have found the child!"  
Sara kept asking herself.  
"I've always remembered it.  
I couldn't make it out at first.  
"She looked so hungry," she said.  
"Oh, have you seen her since then?"

It was not a time for bandying words.  
Let them follow as they list.  
Let's see a match struck up.  
See you set us a good lead."  
"Seize him, and bring him to me."  
I have heard of you this day.  
said I, for I disliked him.  
"You are a good lad," said he.  
I can say thus much for you."  
For what was my cloak to him?  
Then he asked, had I a cloak?  
"Who is Master Penry, then?"  
said I, pulling out my sword.  
The man burst into a laugh.  
Stay here and let us be friends.  
"Are you going to Oxford?"  
"Then it agrees not with you?"  
"But where are you going then?"  
So he took a small helping.  
"Here's to my Queen," said he.  
Lend me your cloak in exchange.  
You have a message for me?"  
"That is well, so far," said he.  
"He lent me this gown," said I.  
Do I know my own pupil?  
HOW I PARTED WITH MY CLOAK.  
Have you not done your errand?"  
"And did he leave aught for me?"  
"But my cloak, he had my cloak."  
Master Penry had been right!  
By my life, a scholar, too.  
"Friend," said he, "what is your name?"  
Whereupon he dropped asleep.  
HOW I WALKED WITH A REBEL.  
"Meanwhile, Humphrey, we are friends.  
He laughed pleasantly at that.  
It comes and goes, I'm told.  
"I was born her enemy.  
I mean Captain Merriman.  
"I warrant you that," said Hugh.  
Yet I could not believe that.  
As I might have known, it was Ludar.  
said he, laughing, "I think not.  
"He is the Devil," said I.  
"My kind protector," she said.  
Here a sore rebuff met me.  
"It is I, Humphrey Dexter.  
Pray Heaven I may be wrong."  
We shall be happy again."  
"And what is to be done now?"  
That was quite enough for me.  
The pleasant 'prentice days were over.  
It was dark when I climbed the palings.  
We should meet perchance again.  
"I expected you," said he.  
This is no place for talking."  
"I am bewitched for my sins.  
"How is she to know of this?"  
She has me at arm's length.  
"'Tis a long journey," said she.  
I played by it as a child.  
Of course we will go by sea.  
Are ye not ashamed, hussy?  
So much the better for us.  
But I waited for no more.  
But he would hear none of it.  
The old nurse is hard to please."  
"The serving man is a fool.  
"A lady," said I, shortly.  
Do you take me for a fool?  
cried he, "thou sickly lubber.  
exclaimed he, when he first came.  
Pray, did you catch any fish to-day?"  
Ludar, pale and blood-stained, stood gloomily by.  
"No, Humphrey," said she, "lie still.  
"Let him bide there a while," said Ludar.  
But tell me, how do you fare?"  
Humphrey, fetch down the poet.  
"_Facilis descensus Averni_, as our Maro hath it.  
Come, you share this watch with me.  
It went hard with me, that night.  
What hindered me, I know not.  
Who runneth from the east like the roe?  
"The McDonnells and O'Neills are neighbours and foes."  
For we floated no colours aloft.  
Then we lost her in the dusk.  
"O truth, many are thy arts!"  
Methinks Scylla were the better fate.  
"She will suffer it from you."  
"That lightens us still more," said Ludar.  
"Humphrey, you are a fool," said Ludar.  
But Ludar laughed when I questioned him.  
Tell me more of her, Humphrey."  
'Drive them back into their kennel!'  
And in what brave company!  
asked the maiden, coming up.  
Pray say, is my father here?"  
Once outside, the gate was closed.  
HOW LUDAR FIRED THE BEACON ON KNOCKLAY.  
Then Ludar said:  "That is the Banshee.  
But Ludar stepped solemnly forward.  
"Because the time had come," said Ludar.  
Here we part company, lads.  
Last night I heard the Banshee."  
"And I," said Alexander.  
The division was soon made.  
"We meet all at Dunluce two days hence."  
"That will I not," said the man.  
I say, we stood--yet not all.  
Lookup, man, or you are lost."  
The effect was magical.  
Now, all was suddenly changed.  
I have other work to do.  
"As you please, comrade," said he.  
It needs not two McDonnells to do that.  
The duel was short and swift.  
But sign of him there was none.  
The honest fellow was right.  
I have forfeited his love.  
"Maiden," said I, "have patience.  
Go back to the wall, Humphrey.  
"My sons," said he, "where are they?"  
"He is dead by now," said I.  
But never a word spake Sorley Boy.  
Let who dares come and take them.  
Keep your papers, John Perrott.  
Let us back to the city."  
"Come," said I; "we are followed."  
But we were out of their reach.  
"I had it from one of the redshanks."  
"Then," said I, sadly, "we part.  
So I left them and wandered citywards.  
"Come," said he, surlily, "bustle hence, thou varlet.  
But, see, you still want some help."  
"Well, sometimes I walk better.  
"Anyone's sake besides?"  
So make a bargain of it."  
"The air is full of treason.  
I asked of one who stood near.  
"Why, to be sure, it was he!  
No work did we 'prentices do that day.  
cried I, as white as paper.  
For he was not amongst them.  
What needs she with two of us?  
You know him--"  "Ay, ay," said I.  
"Lubin, or Ludar, or some such name."  
I got but one glimpse of him.  
"I am sorry I came here."  
"For if you have, I have not."  
"Humphrey, _mon ami_," said she.  
"Nay," said I, "I like the place.  
"You have hit him to a point.  
In an hour--  What was that?  
Men seemed half dazed by the news.  
"Talk of it no more," said she.  
First of all--"  "Hold thy peace, beast!"  
But tell me, what was he like?"  
HOW MASTER WALGRAVE FELL SHORT OF TYPE.  
The which I condescended to promise him.  
"I have not asked her," said she.  
he asked, getting excited.  
"But how will you get it now?"  
Had I been wrong after all?  
These garments I wear are his."  
But the sight of day roused him.  
"Presently I will return.  
While out, I got a great fright.  
We must not go together.  
It had neither oars nor sail.  
The deck was ablaze with pennons and scutcheons.  
said he, in our own tongue.  
HOW THE DONS SAILED UP CHANNEL.  
My heart leapt up at the words.  
But he got more than he gave.  
"Yes; but how is it to end?  
So I was fain to submit.  
He was tall like a giant.  
Whereat I thanked him and went forward.  
But I was in doleful dumps.  
I knew not which way to turn.  
And I told him where and how.  
I exclaimed; "serve that villain?  
Why, how black you look, comrade!"  
Send them forward with all speed.  
One thing I was resolved on.  
Lay to, my men, and spurs all!"  
Well I remembered the place!  
"I understand you, Captain.  
"Sleep on for to-night, dear hearts," said I.  
Who carried them off, and when?"  
He pricked up his ears at that.  
"'Tis too late, I doubt," said he.  
'Twere better to find the maids dead.  
The fellow seemed to speak true.  
Look you well to the others.  
"You talk of beyond the grave."  
"I never talked less of it.  
You know this Irish coast well?"  
"'Tis more than enough," said he.  
"I will do my best," said he.  
"That may put us past Ramore," said he.  
"In the bay beyond that lies Dunluce.  
They are worse than useless now."  
I begged to see the maiden.  
I asked again, presently.  
'Twas Jeannette who answered me.  
"God reward them both for this!"  
As a man, call me thy friend.

"Well, why not be a soldier?"  
"You must not stop at home, Phil.  
That's her pride, Phil, my boy.  
"No, my boy, no," said Mrs Hexton mournfully.  
"Who's going to hev a smoke?"  
"Now then, lads, who wants a leet?"  
"What do you think o' that, lad?"  
"You might have fired the mine."  
"That's all right, I warrant."  
"Oh, it's thy mine, is it?"  
cried one of the men again.  
exclaimed one of the party.  
How did you open that Davy-lamp, sir?"  
"I like the lad, that I do."  
"Have I been asleep, mother?"  
"Oh, she has left out two cups!  
"Yes, I see that," said Philip.  
We must be content with one."  
There it was already made.  
exclaimed Philip mentally.

"I know him well," the smith said.  
But his followers waver.  
His patience was rewarded.  
Such accidents will happen."  
At last these ceased suddenly.  
It was awkwardly managed.  
"Why should I not tell it all?"  
Walter asked indignantly.  
"But how can we prevent it?"  
Edward," the king ejaculated, "how is this?  
"Here it is," the marshal said.  
It will be rare fun, surely."  
But now as to tomorrow.  
I wonder if it will do."  
The king looked somewhat displeased.  
They strove in vain, however.  
The lad now rose to his feet.  
"Well, we shall see," he went on.  
In France it is different.  
"And what land is that ahead?"  
The English fleet are coming!"  
It consisted of twenty-seven knights bannerets and 2000 men-at-arms.  
They grasped the rope and jumped off.  
Bonfires blazed in the streets.  
"She is a ward of the king.  
The Flemish burghers then took their leave.  
His voice was drowned in the roar.  
They were not long in their search.  
"But how are we to descend?"  
Walter looked from the window.  
Have you had better fortune?"  
The villages of St. Germain, St.  
It was, he said, called "La Blanche Tache".  
The English charged them at once.  
No; we will say nought about it.  
"Then, Sir Walter, I name you chatelain.  
It was the turn of the men-at-arms now.  
"Has each of you found his rope?"  
There was nothing to be done.  
"The news is bad," the knight growled.  
He has not escaped surely!  
the other said eagerly.  
The other hesitated.  
But you lie too far away.  
But this boots not at present.  
"It is as I thought," he said.  
Horses there were in plenty.  
Chandos now advised the prince to halt.  
The cry spread through the country.  
A great battle was fought near Cocherel.

There is no disgrace in it.  
"I know that it will be best.  
"I cannot promise, mother.  
"It's natural, my boy.  
On one thing he was resolved.  
the boy replied "Walker, eh?"  
Does yer want to find a crib?"  
"No; I have just come in from Croydon."  
I will ax him if yer likes."  
Bill said contemptuously.  
nor where I had worked before?  
"Of course I am," George replied.  
That's all right; come along.  
He returned in a minute.  
"But you are coming too, aint you?"  
So if yer aint too proud, here goes."  
The boy stopped in the corner.  
"That's much nicer," George said.  
Bill said in astonishment.  
"It would do good, Bill," George said.  
But the best move was just now.  
"That I won't, so help me bob!"  
Bill said in solemn wonder.  
You aint been a-prigging apples or a-putting him out.  
That's what I wants to know."  
There was a cry of "Stop, thief!"  
"Here is my locket again."  
"Why, where did you get it from?"  
"Why didn't you stop him, my dear?"  
"Was he a poor boy, Nellie?"  
"Oh, yes, I am sure I should.  
"I did not wait to see, Bill.  
Bill meditated for a minute or two.  
"A good deal more than that, Bill."  
My eye, but yer are a flat!"  
"What sort of work do you want?  
"And are you all alone here?"  
"And your friend too, if he likes.  
You are as strong as I am."  
That's how I looks at it."  
"Blest if I can find my shirt.  
Bill looked in astonishment.  
"Why, where did yer get 'em, George?  
"What have you to cry about?"  
"Why, talk about the Garden!  
Lor', why it aint nothing to it.  
"No, I don't think so," George said.  
George asked as they left the house.  
Bill had at first protested.  
"How do those boys do their work?"  
"What do you think of that, George?  
"We won't put it all by, Bill.  
"And how much for a whole house?"  
"It depends upon the size.  
Grimstone exclaimed in astonishment.  
"We don't look like it," George laughed.  
"What do you think of this, Bill?"  
Mother will help you at that."  
But we shall just catch the train.  
What a pretty little place!  
"What a snug little kitchen!"  
We must wait for that, you know."  
It seems too good to be true."  
Bill put his hand out shyly.  
"That will be jolly, mother.  
Manners make the man, you know!  
CHAPTER V.  AN ADVENTURE.  
What on earth are we to do?"  
They set steadily to work.  
Oh, I say, aint my hands blistered!"  
Listen--there's another.  
I have an idea, Bill!"  
"I wish this fog would clear off!"  
I feel awfully hungry."  
"Yes, but not in August, Bill."  
Listen; I can hear voices.  
Now let's take a look round."  
"What do you think of it, Jack?"  
"Don't know," the other replied.  
"It's a-coming, sure enough," the bargeman said.  
Never mind about the boat.  
I will put that square for you.  
"I didn't like it either, Bill.  
It's regular spoilt the day.  
"Yes, I saw it," Bill agreed.  
You can breathe if you kneel down."  
How on earth did you get here?"  
Bill said; "this is a steamer.  
I expect they will do now."  
But this George would not hear of.  
"Whatever has happened, boys?"  
Why, it's past eleven!"  
"Why didn't you wake us, mother?"  
"Good-morning, Mr. Grimstone," Mrs. Andrews said.  
Mrs. Andrews looked surprised.  
"No, not till you have done, George.  
"Shall I go in with you, boys?"  
Bob asked when they reached the door.  
"Yes, please, Bob, I wish you would."  
"Well, what did the doctor say?"  
The boys jumped up in surprise.  
I hope you are not much burned."  
"You see it too, don't you, Bill?"  
"I thank you, indeed," she said.  
The inhabitants of No.  
"Yes, sir, I did that first thing."  
"Is she safe; was I in time?"  
"The foot is crushed to a pulp.  
"Are you in any great pain?"  
Bill followed the procession heart-broken.  
"And didn't it hurt it awful?"  
"It won't make much odds, you know.  
"I don't know, dad," the boy said.  
"That's right," the old man said.  
What can you want more than that?"  
"All except poor Tom Hardy.  
"What time must you leave, Harry?"  
you are one meddlesome fool."  
"Will she be zere true to her time?"  
the Frenchman asked the smuggler.  
This he repeated three times.  
"There are two to come on board."  
"Harry Langley," he replied.  
"I should indeed, sir," he said.  
"But what have you been doing?  
I will arrange about it."  
Presently the boy returned.  
I wonder where it can be?"  
He must do the best he can.  
"Will you do as I order?"  
"How on earth did he do that?"  
I will adopt it myself.  
There is little more to tell.  
I shouted; 'hould on for your lives!  
I can't hold on much longer.'  
"Presently Bill says, 'Good-by, father.  
"'That is nice and strong,' she said; 'thank you.  
"'We've been waiting a long time, Joe.  
"'Are you sure you are going right?'  
With a southwester they can run back here."  
"That's curious," I said.  
said I; "not go out, mother!  
"That's not all, Will," she said.  
"I wish I knew which it was."  
"I doubt he'll come round," I said.  
"Get ready, lad," Jabez said to me.  
The big fellow had leapt up.

exclaimed Captain Horatio Passford.  
asked the mother anxiously.  
"Nothing could suit me better."  
"I was about to tell you.  
It was at your age that Charles XII.  
added the owner's son.  
"Pray how old are you, my friend?"  
"Oh, now I think of her name!  
"I mean no meridian.  
"My name is Percy Pierson.  
"What did you say your name was?  
"Then you won't tell me your name.  
"Quite enough of it," assented Christy.  
"What have you got there, Mr.  
"I understand your motives."  
"But your mother is at home."  
"I feel almost sure of it."  
"Beeks has the wheel, I believe?"  
"Yes; and Thayer is with him."  
"You must do all the talking."  
"But she don't hail from Nassau.  
"Why didn't you say so before?"  
I think it must be all right."  
exclaimed the older brother.  
"What am I to do, Mr.  
"Now may I ask who owns her?"  
"De Lo'd bless Massa Christy!"  
But I could not leave you here.  
You really want to go home?"  
"Then I won't ask it again.  
"Then you don't like him, do you?"  
"I don't understand it so."  
"What is the matter, papa?"  
"Won't you go over with me?  
asked Christy good-naturedly.  
"Then, why do you arrest me?"  
demanded the rising form.  
"I haven't the least idea.  
"Then, you have been fooling me?"  
"Didn't he tell you who he was?"  
"But when did the Bellevite leave the wharf?"  
"Well, Percy, how goes it now?"  
"And you met my father there?"  
"What have you got there, Mr.  
"That is the work of Captain Pecklar.  
"Well, what have you been about, Dallberg?"  
"That is where he was quite right."  
added the major, laughing.  
"Lots of them," answered Christy.  
"The steamer has turned about!"  
"How is the sick man, Percy?"  
added the major sternly.  
"Are you coining back to-day, major?"  
"I reckon I do," replied Spikeley.  
"How do you know I am not?"  
"You may see him before long.  
The other is the speed bell."  
"I can show myself to him.  
Percy was all attention.  
You will blow the whole thing up!"  
That's another fellow?"  
What do you see over there?"  
"What's that to you, youngster?"  
"What do you want to know for?"  
asked the captain anxiously.  
I will tell you about it."  
"Just as you think best, Mr.  
"What is the reason I won't?"  
"How do you get on, Captain Pecklar?"  
"I am glad you are better.  
"What makes you think it is she?"  
"Where is she going, Christy?"  
"What am I to steer for now?  
Shall I make her follow the Bellevite?"  
replied the acting captain.  
"I will do this work myself.  
"Perhaps he suspects you are.  
"I will stick to it, Christy."  
They are firing rifle-balls from the Belle.  
"By the great Constitution!"  
"That's what's the matter!"  
"What shall we do with this tug?"  
"He can if any one can.  
"But where is Florry, father?"  
asked the fair maiden, laughing.

Everybody says they are."  
Were there any white women?  
No, it could not have been a trading-party.  
Did you ever see any?"  
"More warriors than we have."  
"I've been among 'em seven.  
But then I never would paint."  
What could a cavalryman do with a lance?  
"No Tongue has the heart of a Lipan.  
"Are we so near the border?"  
"You lived in Mexico once?"  
Did I ever tell you that?"  
"Did you have a fight with them?"  
She owned the mine and the land.  
"Then they are better than mine.  
"No, not sick--it says too much.  
"I don't believe he hates me."  
She likes me best, that's all."  
There could be no doubt of that.  
She was not the mother of Ni-ha-be.  
"I've spoken to old Two Knives.  
"Can't say about that, my boy.  
"I never blamed my uncle.  
"Give me the next shot, Murray."  
"I fell right down upon it.  
But it isn't of any use."  
"I will if I live, Murray."  
There must be bushels of it."  
But I don't know what it means."  
It will all come back to me by-and-by.  
I will go and be alone."  
No two of them were alike.  
I wore a dress like that once.  
Why did they not put him in?  
Oh, he was so good to me!  
and had it come back to her?  
But what can I do with it?"  
It isn't a love of money.  
Didn't I tell you what keeps me?  
How old do you think I am?"  
And you know all about mines."  
Nobody knows who they were.  
It was a good place for one.  
And then again it might not.  
I must look out for you, Steve.  
"I'm man enough, Murray.  
Think of the deer, not of the gold-mine."  
They always give them a name."  
"That'll do as well as any.  
We may get a shot at him."  
Some of the boys might let out somethin'."  
"Guess it's Mexico, then.  
"The great Southern Pass is down hereaway, somewhar."  
"They carried that deer somewhere."  
Or they may have captured 'em.  
I'm kind o' glad they did.  
That there ledge is ours now.  
So blue-coat soldier throw them away."  
She'll tell you if you ask her."  
Red Wolf is a warrior.  
Old braves in camp say they know.  
My eyes are better than hers.  
"Rita, what is the matter?  
Have they said strong words to you?"  
"I can tell you some of it."  
Many Bears is a great chief.  
"I'm going to keep them."  
They beckoned to Red Wolf first.  
"What did they say to the chief?"  
I did not tell your father.  
I am very good to you."  
"Of course I will," said Rita.  
Make good warrior some day."  
We may have to live on that."  
"It won't be necessary."  
"I can't see it very well."  
What a valley it is, too!  
No use for us to go back.  
That ledge isn't badly broken.  
"We can't leave a claim like this."  
"We'll try it to-morrow," said the Captain.  
"That's what we're gwine to look for.  
"They are almost all talking.  
But where is my white father?  
They are as wild as rabbits.  
They will lose their scalps some day."  
"I understand," he muttered.  
Not afraid of anything."  
"He is saying ugly things.  
"I am an Apache girl!  
"Red Wolf is a warrior.  
He is not a coyote.  
"What's the matter, Murray?"  
They sha'n't touch a hair of their heads!"  
We must take them unawares.  
Don't one of ye lift a hand."  
Not mine," he said to Murray.  
"Who shall I tell him you are?"  
"It's that other one, Steve.  
"It's no use, boys," said Bill.  
whispered Ni-ha-be; "they ought to be burnt."  
"Steve, you had better say yes.  
It may be a lift for you."  
"Was he not handsome, Rita?"  
I want to see them again."  
We was sent ahead to scout."  
"Now, stranger, you've got me thar.  
"Well, I'll tell you what we'll do.  
"Never mind about the mine.  
"You know about that, do ye?"  
"I know enough to warn you."  
"What can you do with it here?"  
There's too many of 'em."  
"The one we saw to-day looked like a Lipan."  
I want to know what they've done."  
How many redskins was there?"  
"Thar's the hole in my arm."  
It's our only show."  
What's the matter with you to-day?  
There was no danger from them.  
Our title's all gone!"  
He is a great warrior.  
Then he not come back at all."  
I wish I could say we were."  
"Signs are getting pretty thick.  
Cut in two, and blood on it.  
"This 'ere's the very place, Cap.  
They said they'd take thar chances.  
That isn't our direction.  
"He wasn't his boy," said Rita.  
"He didn't look like him a bit."  
"Not good for much, anyhow.  
"He's too lazy for that.  
And he's afraid of her.  
Look at the things on their heads."  
Only black in the pictures.  
"Do the leaves talk all the while?"  
Here are ever so many.  
Have you found either of them?"  
Most of them are very long.  
I'll call you when your time comes."  
"You can't have it," grumbled Steve.  
They're both in good condition."  
You're the queerest pair I ever saw.  
"Send Warning is a good friend.  
"Thar's a big swarm of 'em.  
"It is if we anger them.  
Thar'll be a hot time, thar will!"  
We ort to have follered your advice."  
"Ort not to have left the camp."  
"Kill every soul of 'em."  
"Now, boys, save every shot."  
We're close to the border now."  
There was very little wind.  
Just as bright as they are now.  
He was very good to me.  
"What is the matter, Rita?"  
scornfully remarked old Too Many Toes.  
Young warrior good friend too.  
Send Warning tell friend what do."  
Both get scared and go away.  
That was the difficulty.  
"After one would be the worst.  
Alas for her, however!  
Don't you see who is coming?"  
I'll speak if I get a chance."  
You are no better than a pale-face."  
The old men would push him back."  
He must eat my venison."  
Old warrior stay with chiefs.  
"Young men go," said Many Bears.  
"Send Warning stay with gray heads."  
I am an Apache now.  
"Red Wolf is an Apache.  
His father is a great chief.  
"I don't know; I will find out.  
Daughters of great chief himself."  
She will bring the talking leaves by-and-by.  
He'll stop some of that yelling."  
Oh, don't I wish I was thar!"  
What are they gwine to do with us?"  
The Apaches are small dogs.  
We are not afraid of them."  
Give back all you took from them."  
Give them one day after fight."  
"One wagon's nothing, boys.  
"I can't guess how he did it."  
This is our team of mules."  
"We must throw the redskins off to-night.  
"Well, not any more'n we can help."  
"So are the bars and nuggets."  
"And I've got all I keer to spend.  
"For the Lipans to find the next day?  
"Is the great chief sure of that?"  
Apaches need more braves then.  
All braves go and eat a heap.  
Get ready to cross river.  
Steve and I must get away to-morrow.  
"I'm not looking at them."  
Your horse's feet are slipping."  
"Rita, did you look at them?"  
Or was it only Red Wolf?"  
Not know enough to keep dry.  
It's your fight more than mine.  
Have fight among ourselves.  
It's half a sort of lake.  
The river comes out of it.  
"May run against Apaches."  
"Got to take our chances."  
If they could but find a ford!  
I was half afraid of that."  
"It's on the other shore!"  
Hear that--off to the northward?  
There's a fight going on.  
We're away in behind it."  
"How came this critter here, then?"  
This one wasn't even branded.  
The chief could understand that.  
"Or if the camp is attacked.  
Great chief marry Mexican squaw.  
Many Bears is a great chief.  
"What a kind, sweet voice he has!  
He cannot speak Apache.  
I am on the right track now."  
It won't do to lose my friends.  
Creep through hole in back of lodge.  
"Rita, there is Knotted Cord!"  
Do you understand English?"  
Many Bears turned to Murray.  
"Send Warning gave good council.  
Find too many Apaches.  
Nobody know where they go.  
Apaches take Lipan prisoners.  
Something else to think of now.  
He is miles and miles away."  
Apaches do what think best."  
Let me ask you a question.  
Did the Lipans go away on foot?"  
"They are cunning warriors.  
Catch 'em when they come to pass."  
"Better ride now," said Murray.  
"Say yes, Steve," muttered Murray.  
"Glad come among Apaches.  
"He is not an Apache!"  
He is nothing but an old pale-face!"  
The great chief listens to him.  
All the warriors listen.  
"He is not a warrior.  
He did not go out and fight."  
He will send for Dolores."  
She is as bad as Rita.  
Better not see young squaws just now.  
Well, I think the Lipans are not fools."  
It was a disappointment.  
I can see a wagon-wheel sticking up."  
It's gold coin--twenty-dollar gold pieces.  
Besides, it never was theirs.  
The chances were against them.  
He has never been on a war-path."  
Rita replied, "He is young.  
"It's hard to guess, Murray.  
Maybe she's forty-five."  
"Then it will keep me, Murray.  
His pale-face friend had been very wise.  
Many Bears want to hear more."  
Nobody come into lodge.  
"I am an Apache girl?  
"I will read the first word, dear.  
That means a gold-mine, like ours, dear.  
Spell it, Rita, my darling."  
Slowly she opened her eyes.  
Tell the braves to get ready.  
There was no opposition.  
I can change a little more.  
They know me for a long-bearded old man.  
No wonder my hair is white.  
Here, give me a magazine.  
I must find my way back now.  
He spoke to her in Spanish.  
Ah, seor, it is so long ago!  
But our gold coin won't do.  
You've helped me out of my scrape."  
shouted the little Captain.  
There's more'n three hundred of 'em.  
You are our prisoners."  
"No harm is intended you, seor.  
We can pay our own way."  
They may have been successful."  
"That's reasonable, Cap."  
It's the best we can do."  
They were in their own country.  
Or would one of the other caballeros?  
"We're anything but that, Steve.  
"So I did, and he answered, 'Ugh!  
All he needs now is a young squaw.  
Plenty young squaw have no father.  
Suppose you say what you think?  
Send Warning in no hurry.  
"Cheaper than blankets, my boy.  
"She is an Apache now.  
"She is to be his daughter."  
Then he will take her away."  
He will never have any.  
How will he pay for Rita?"  
You are not a pale-face any more.  
Then Send Warning go with chief.  
Come back and take young squaw to lodge."  
I'll buy you a new rifle.  
Are all your presents ready?"  
Send Warning has kept his word.  
Rita is my own daughter.  
Send Warning is a wise man.  
You will go with your father.  
Many Bears was listening.  
"Send Warning hear what young squaw say?  
Nearer it came and nearer.  
"There, Rita," said her father.

"Get your arm well under him.  
Wants to lie down, constable.  
"Oh, that's it, is it, sir?"  
Is anything the matter?"  
"Yes, Miss--one over the door."  
My brother has not come back."  
"Who else on the premises?"  
Who's likely to be here?"  
"But you do alarm me, man.  
She rapped smartly on the door.  
"Yes," she said, "force it open.  
"Hold hard, please, Miss, and keep back.  
Elderly gent with bald head."  
do you think I am a child?"  
Prop it open with a chair.  
"There's something else wrong there."  
My father attacked, and--Oh?  
"Yes, for pity's sake, look."  
"Why, constable, what's up?  
No, sir, I wouldn't let her come.  
That poor girl must be half wild."  
We cannot leave him like that.  
"How did all this come about?"  
Nothing more can be done now.  
We will be here quite early."  
But to allay suffering.  
how unreasonable, Richmond!  
But don't trouble about it.  
I must get on with my work."  
What's she gone away for?"  
What cowards gals are to cry!"  
"I'll slip round and let you in."  
I've all my lessons to give to-day.  
"You made him behave nobly.  
"Yes," said Richmond, with a sigh.  
Miss Chartley, is the doctor within?"  
"Yes, of course; so it is, Miss Chartley.  
"Yes, with sugar, if you liked.  
"No," said the doctor, smiling.  
"And I could not afford--"  "Yah!  
Wine and spirit trade, indeed!  
Now then, doctor, go ahead.  
"Do you mean--"  "Yes, that's it.  
How you can put it, doctor!  
"Why, you're her father, ain't you?"  
"Does my daughter sanction this?"  
Richmond is not like most girls."  
"And he's abroad, isn't he?"  
"But you took the fees, doctor?"  
Surely we earn our fees."  
"Then you knew I was all right?"  
Going to see a lady."  
"Don't take all that trouble, pray."  
"Ah, you'll break your neck some day.  
Here's a shilling for you.  
Take me into Miss Chartley at once."  
"No, don't tell her anything.  
"Here, I say, mother, stow that.  
"No, you sha'n't, you ungrateful boy.  
"Here, I say, don't cry on the front-doorsteps.  
Now she'll go and have a drop.  
She allus does when she says she won't."  
Did he know where you had been?"  
"Why, Bob, your hand's bleeding!"  
"You are all over mud, too.  
Don't send a feller away."  
Jest because I takes out the physic.  
I shouldn't like to tell you what."  
She allus comes when I'm busy."  
said Elizabeth promptly.  
"Yes, and he looks at her so."  
There's the money; take it.  
"I will not take the money.  
You deceived me once before."  
"Then how did you come by it?"  
What is a fellow to do?  
"Well, what are you shouting at?"  
It's all Janet's fault."  
I never encouraged him.  
some day," said Hendon sadly.  
"What have you been doing, Bob?"  
"So'm I proud on him, Miss.  
For it's like 'evin being here.  
"No, no, Bob," she said gently.  
"Stop a moment, Miss," cried Bob.  
"Yes, a little congestion!"  
Is my father still asleep?"  
"'Lisbeth," he said, and there was a knock.  
I shouldn't turn sulky if it was hern."  
Come, come: what's the matter?"  
So you have been hunted, eh?"  
Your brain is as sound as mine."  
"Fiends--demons in human form.  
"Be calm, my dear boy, be calm.  
"To be sure; it will rest you.  
Save me, doctor, for you can."  
"I am sorry to hear that."  
Knew I was a wealthy man."  
"Yes," was the drowsy reply.  
"Then began the curse of it.  
"It is only I--Doctor Chartley.  
"Imagination, poor wretch!"  
Suppose he slept and waked no more?  
He came to me for refuge.  
It will be a simple way."  
"It might be," he said softly.  
He glanced at his visitors.  
"I never saw such a fog.  
"Oh, no; it's all gone now.  
It is a man's nature.  
he gasped, in a hoarse whisper.  
"What is it, Harry--poison?"  
Look at old Roger's eyes."  
get 'em out, and let's go!"  
"What are you going to do?"  
Hendon Chartley gave his evidence.  
"Would he know the men again?"  
"Do you take me for a thief?"  
"I'm not afraid of her.  
I don't care how much it is."  
Will you allow me to pass?"  
He does not owe you money?"  
You tried to keep him away.  
He wouldn't own it; but I know.  
said the young man, with a groan.  
Why was he wandering on?  
she said, with a pleasant smile.  
"Heath--Mark Heath," he said quickly.  
"You have sent to my sister?"  
"I will make inquiries."  
"Yes, but that was dreaming, dear."  
"Oh, Mark, what you have suffered!  
"Must it not have been a dream?"  
"How cruel you are, Janet!"  
"I must not stay long," she said.  
Mark does not like to be left.  
"Why, Rich, how strangely you talk!"  
and he knows me well enough.  
They think he must hold the clue."  
"No, no, no--impossible!  
If you will not stir, I shall."  
She turned upon him sharply.  
he cried, with a bitter laugh.  
"You drag it from me," he groaned.  
"I tell you I can't pay you.  
Now, are you going to pay?"  
cried Hendon furiously.  
"Damn you, and your cigars too!"  
"There, you won't make me waxy.  
Hendon glared at him wildly.  
All right: answer me this, then.  
"Come, come, you're sensible now.  
cried Hendon passionately.  
"My sister is not at home."  
"To be sure she is, old boy.  
I remember--remember.  
"Is this man going, Hendon?"  
whispered Mark impatiently.  
"I'm not going, doctor.  
"You're going to set me right."  
You remember then, doctor?"  
"Why do you interfere, sir?"  
BOB IS EXPLANATORY.  
"Yes, yes, Bob; but pray go on."  
"I am glad the guvner's better.  
"But you say you saw me come!"  
"Did you hear anything else?"  
"Should you know the men again?"  
"Why did you not come to us?"  
"I did want to, Miss, but I dursn't.  
I shall tempt my fate again."  
Why didn't the boy bring it up?"  
"Is it from the hospital?"  
We shall be up again soon."  
"But is the news very bad?"  
No, no; he will not give up.  
"What, with Janet's money?  
"To do what I like with, sir?"  
"Then I wants some on it now!"  
cried the boy excitedly.

"What makes you think so, Johnson?"  
And this brings us to a point.  
"You're early afloat, Mounseer," he said.  
The very next year (1851) Mr T.R.  
Robin is a mere child yet.  
"You must learn to  
p'onounce your words popperly, dear.  
asked Madge, with a puzzled look.  
Holland, I think, or Denmark."  
Look-out now, and be ready to catch.  
But--I say--"  

"What's wrong now?"  
Many offices are so.  
They are not imbeciles or idlers.  
"Is Mr Lowstoft in his office?"  
"D'you know that that is Cyrus Field?"  
demanded the second clerk.  
But, I say--be merciful.  
Don't overdo it, Frederick.  
Haydn was nothing to you.  
"The Atlantic Cable, Madge."  
What may _you_ be,  
young feller?"  
demanded the lad curtly.  
"But what did the poor wife do?"  
"Ay, but how long did it last?"  
THE BIG SHIP--FIRST NIGHT ABOARD.  
"Who is he, you ignorant crokidile!  
But, of course, you 'aven't  
bin introdooced to him.  
As Slagg justly remarked, "It was stunnin'."  
If _I'm_ to fight, _you_  
must pray!  
It was drawing near to  
dawn.  
Now, d'you understand that, Robin?"  
"Of course; how stupid I am!"  
The Hawk was sent home again.  
"`_I_ don't believe in 'em, Jeff.  
It's in this  
dark passage.  
What  
_do_ it do, Mr Wright?  
Now, do you understand it?"  
"An enemy in the ship!"  
"You're right, Joe," said another.  
Nevertheless, it was  
done.  
A fourth attempt was then made.  
"Are any labourers to go with us?"  
"There's no saying, Robin.  
There was urgent need for haste.  
Sam stopped as if suddenly paralysed.  
"Hoist away now--with a will!"  
If  
you don't you're a dead man!  
I'll look into  
it now, Sam."  
"Well, what do you make of it?"  
"Don't `mister' me any more, Slagg.  
Who's goin' to make the  
first reslootion?"  
"And without pay," suggested Slagg.  
The leg and foot were naked.  
Then Slagg looked round with a  
deep sigh.  
"Our prayer has been answered!"  
ejaculated Robin in consternation.  
"There may be some left alive!"  
"The sea-gulls could not  
make it, Robin.  
"Did _He_ send you to fetch me?"  
"Your other name, dear," said Sam.  
"And what was mamma's name?"  
"O yes, very _very_ long!"  
"No, but she would be sorry.  
"But won't you let us go too?"  
"O yes, if you want to come.  
Sit down an'  
grub wat yous can.  
laughed Sam through a mouthful of pie-crust.  
"Yes, little one,--wonderful!"  
"Oh, I'm so glad you've come!"  
"`What's the matter, madam?'  
Help me to strip him, Robin."  
"Why; he's not worse, is he?"  
"Ay, that's just what she was."  
asked Robin in  
great surprise.  
Letta was puzzled by this reply.  
This time consciousness returned.  
repeated Letta; "where have you been?  
"There, I'm muddled again!"  
"Muddled again," said Johnson.  
Letta went a short distance with  
them.  
Perhaps  
your mother lives there, Letta."  
"I'm not very hopeful.  
But here  
comes Sam; he looks pleased.  
The child shook her head sadly.  
Ask the girl, Letta, what his  
name is."  
take me to mamma, Georgie."  
"I suppose you mean Bombay?"  
Nigh two years since she goed away."  
BOMBAY--WHERE STUMPS COMES TO GRIEF.  
I do beg your pardon, sir.  
Allow me to dust your sleeve."  
Yours is going well, I think."  
said Stumps with a vacant stare.  
Down in the dumps so low--O!"  
You have scarcely  
mentioned him."  
"It's what I calls a tremendious undertakin'," said Slagg.  
"How do you manage that, sir?"  
it's me  
heart was broke intirely wi' them.  
"Let  
me introduce Mr Slagg.  
"Why don't ye shoot yerself, Mister Flinn?"  
asked Slagg on one occasion  
while reloading.  
I  
_couldn't_ fire at that."  
He could not believe his eyes!  
Excuse me, Mrs Redpath.  
"Yes, quite sure, and very soon."  
"You're so impatient, Robin.  
Let's go and see," said Sam.  
"I know him slightly," said Sam.  
asked Sam as they went  
along.  
"Why, the best is yet to come."  
from a fussy  
guest; and _Hush!  
said Mr Wright, anxiously.  
Bah, I'm an idiot!  
"Yes, I've got one named Gibson.  
Health will never more return.  
cried the captain, struggling.  
"Whom do you refer to, George?"  
The Lord came to save _sinners_.  
I don't, and you _know_ I don't!"  
Be confidential, my boy.  
You're not in love,  
are--"  

"Hush, Sam!  
echoed Robin, "how is that?  
"Ay, ay, Sunbeam, quite finished."  
Then all was again dark as Erebus.  
There, we'll do famously  
now."  
Stumps is splutterin' behind us like a grampus.  
He did wait for the morrow.  
"No, I have not dared," said Sam.  
It is merely your good-natured fancy.  
You must consider  
the girl.

said the other, much surprised.  
"He has never heard of me!  
Have I a right to do that?"  
"If it is, I'll let her out."  
"What are you going to do?"  
Do you not feel happier?  
I have really grown younger.  
"I'll make you suffer for this.  
"Put me down, and I will go.  
Did you think of it yourself?"  
It does not matter to me.  
"But how soon can you return?"  
"And do you always do it?"  
"What kind of a place is this?"  
"It is a robber's den!  
"You ought to have been along.  
I do not like a thing here!"  
"This is indeed surprising!"  
It was a strange procession.  
"I asked them," said the Stranger.  
"Go back to my son's house!"  
"Very well," said the Captain.  
Have the vessel turned northward."  
"I suppose he has gone home.  
"Yes," replied the man, "you can."  
Then they are a nucleus.  
"This is luxury," roared the Jolly-cum-pop.  
And he went forth to meet them.  
"Have you any specialty?"  
I will see what I can do."  
The first thing is to find them."  
But this cannot now be done.  
There the contest will take place.  
The eyes of Alberdin sparkled with joy.  
"Let the Autocracy go!"  
"I prefer things as they are.  
Now we are all satisfied."  
I want my own ideas."  
"Give it up," replied the King.  
The Sphinx accompanied him.  
Cut him down, if he resists!"  
The Princess decided it.

"Well, it won't be the first time."  
"Except supper," said Lumley.  
"There seems to be--nothing--stay!  
They went at it together.  
Thought is quick--quicker than words.  
shouted the men from the roof.  
where was water to come from?  
"My noz was froz," he replied curtly.  
it's terribly slow work.  
Come  
in, come in, and welcome!"  
To this the red-man responded "ho!"  
--not interrogatively  
but interjectionally--with much gravity.  
responded his companion.  
He prevailed  
after some time.  
Have you  
ever been at Fort Dunregan?"  
How  
did ye feel next morning?"  
But now Macnab was helpless.  
There--my arm round  
your neck--so.  
AN EXPRESS AND ITS RESULTS.  
exclaimed the elder savage.  
"We shall soon see--give way, lads!"  
"No," answered the Indian.  
Almost as good as this  
bone."  
"Is it to stop here, we are?"  
it's well ye didn't try, Shames."  
It wass the egg you did  
smell."  
They are not much to boast of."  
"Ferry coot," answered Dougall.  
come oot, man, an' fetch a stick wi' you.  
"I do believe I've killed him.  
War shall cease at his  
bidding.  
We'll soon have a hut ready.  
"No--not till after breakfast."  
To my surprise she had fled!  
I shall never know it now."  
She looked at me gratefully.  
"I do not know," she replied.  
For her sake I shall remain.  
"`Do not open it,' he said.  
See, they prepare for action!"  
This was very obvious.  
The carpenter shook his head.  
"Now, Coppet, lend a hand at the winch.  
Black eyes riveted once more!  
"Can you guess where it comes through?"  
I wonder what she's like?"  
Now then, Max, clap on more wood.  
The one in front is  
styled a cariole.  
Lumley, my boy, how are ye?  
Have  
you really got one here?"  
asked Jessie, at that moment.  
Next day the party left us.  
Well, and how did  
they get on?  
Encampment comfortable?  
It would never do--  
never."  
My name is William Liston.  
It may be  
that she is dead.  
How could I do otherwise?"  
Is he  
not a great hunter?  
There was a bank of snow near.  
At last there could be no doubt.  
Waboose knew that he was in earnest.  
Attick  
fled and they saw him no more."  
"Did Waboose tell Big Otter all this?"  
"Of course, of course," said Lumley.  
At the same moment  
the councillors rose.  
"Attick has doubled back, that is all.  
"It is Attick," was the brief reply.  
"Attick scorns to run away with a squaw.  
Your father is not dead, but sleepeth.  
Why should he have another?  
"You never heard of Liston?"  
"She is quite worn out," said I.  
It may at least  
revive her."  
she murmured, in a faint voice.  
"I have  
brought you some of the pale-faces' sweet-water.  
"We may not stay here," he said.  
"Let them come," he said, quickly.  
Be ready to follow me."  
But He is our Father.  
He is nobody--nothing!"  
He  
must be a father to Waboose.  
You tell  
me that you have gold?"  
"True, Eve, true; it must be that.  
"Four summers have passed since then.  
They  
talked much of the Strong Elk.  
"I waited to hear no more.  
When the pale-faces came, we were ready.  
"Well, he has reason to be!"  
"You have been directed aright, sir.  
"Well, I will bring her to you.  
Every one loved Weeum the Good.  
He was so kind,  
and so brave!  
She cannot reveal it now.  
Come, dear dad, if  
you love me.  
a letter from Punch at last!"  
`Given up the service,' too!  
Much _you_ know about farming!  
Why didn't you `consult' me, then?  
`perfection,' undoubtedly.  
wh-why--  
what do you glare like _that_ for?"  
"There is much game," he answered.  
"Certainly, dear one," said I.  
The pines are  
black by contrast.  
Jack Lumley is likewise there.  
Macnab shook his head, sadly.  
This was a judicious touch.  
Mysterious connection!  
"And she has accepted you?"  
"Yes, she has accepted me.  
You are a namesake, you know.  
There are lots of  
Maxbys in the world!"  
Like lightning he sprang erect.  
It was insupportable.  
The stars gave enough of light.  
But I must cut matters short.

"You are quite right," cried the King.  
"We will pay your debts," they said.  
"Will you take half my treasures?"  
"Follow me to my palace."  
"It is quite true," said the King.  
"How can we find this bronze ring?"  
I cannot get used to it!"  
"No, that I am not," said she.  
"Yes, indeed, I am," she said.  
said the South Wind, "is that she?  
"What are you crying about?"  
I have looked at you enough.  
At last the happy day came.  
said the Fairy, quite deceived.  
"What more is there to tell you?"  
"She believes that I love her!"  
What is to be done to undeceive her?"  
Let me explain everything.  
cried the Princess, "must you die?  
He knocked at the door--tap, tap.  
"You have waited a long while."  
followed by a jeering crowd.  
"What unholy pranks are these?  
if I could only shudder!"  
"No," he answered, "how should I?  
if I could only shudder!  
if I could only shudder!"  
if I could only shudder!  
if I could only shudder!"  
if I could only shudder!"  
said he; "what long nails you've got!  
All of a sudden--crash, crash!  
Then he said: "What a pity!  
"No, not if you have money."  
"How have you got on this time?"  
if I could only shudder!"  
"My necklace," replied the girl.  
"Some demon has told you that!  
some demon has told you that!"  
"What would that matter to you?"  
Par Madame de Villeneuve.  
"That's a nice kind of soup.  
"How much are you to have then?"  
"Will it soon be ready now?"  
"Where in the world have you been?"  
He asked if it could make salt.  
The partition was soon made.  
I like order in my house."  
"You are not very rich, then?"  
Shall I punish him for it?"  
He cracked it, and there lay a cherry-stone.  
"Are the ladies beautiful?"  
"Will you do something for me?"  
There is near it a large stone.  
said the second gray woman.  
"Have you lost the eye, sister?  
Before long he saw Galifron coming.  
for she had not learned English.  
"A friend," answered the other.  
"What friend can come at this unseasonable time?"  
she said in the kindest way.  
"You seem very sorrowful."  
"Here is a sheep that can talk."  
"Why do you complain, Princess?"  
he closed the door and went home.  
He said: "Open, Sesame!"  
But Hansel comforted her.  
"Snow-white and Rose-red,   Don't beat your lover dead."  
I'll give you all my treasure.  
As she drank she murmured: "Oh!  
heaven, what am I to do?"  
heaven, what am I to do?"  
"You have committed three faults.  
The first words he spoke were: "Oh!  
"Is there no escape for him?"  
my most trusty John, pardon!  
I'm just on my way there.  
"What's to come of it all?"  
There'll soon be an end of us."  
I could only look upward.  
"Hast thou the golden apple?"  
"Prince," said she, "go when you please.  
Go and pursue your journey."  
"Oh, admirable potion!"  
Pray how did you sleep last night?  
You shall see an example."  
Sae they took her in, and aff they set.

Another ten names will do.  
Jack heard the news in silence.  
Jack went up to one of these.  
That's your sort, I reckon.  
Most of your time's your own.  
Jack nodded with a half smile.  
"Why do you wish to see it?"  
"You won't," Dame Anthony said scornfully.  
I will write to her at once."  
I don't look like it, do I?  
They were good shots both of them.  
There was a cry, 'We are sinking!'  
I looked round just as I leaped.  
When I came up I looked round.  
How long have you been with them?'  
"You are sure those are the trees?'  
"'What sentries are there on at night?'  
The gunner applied the match.  
"Are you sure of what you say?"  
It is useless to resist.  
"Better stop here," the earl said.  
The appeal was not in vain.  
Velasco again refused.  
Corn was brought for the horses.  
But we will do so in groups.  
What an escape it has been!  
"Shall I shoot these fellows, sir?"  
He opened it and entered.  
how glad I am to see you!  
If so--" And she stopped again.  
"These men are the count's guests.  
This explained the mystery.  
What am I to say or do?  
"Mary, mother of heaven!"  
"None whatever," the count said.  
he said when he had read it.  
This programme was carried out.  
Like yourself, they are Catholics.  
Four or five of these were priests.  
A few casks of wine were broached.  
Jack exclaimed indignantly.  
"We shall see," Jack said, laughing.  
The priest ran into the room.  
But the fall of Montjuich was at hand.  
They were soon at the surface.  
"And is he going home, sir?"  
We got safely through the house.  
Presently two monks came in.  
There they kept me for six days.  
"Then there was a fresh howling.  
"Perhaps not, Captain Stilwell.  
"How do you do, Cousin Jack?"  
"How are you, Cousin Alice?"  
"Well, go on," Jack said gravely.

The kilt was worn over this.  
The struggle was a short one.  
Amuba said, struggling to his feet.  
Nothing will be attempted to-day.  
Do you not think so, Jethro?"  
"They are to stay here, my son.  
"And have you been in battle?"  
[Illustration: C. of B.  
"There is an answer for you, Mysa."  
There, children, you can go now.  
"Truly it is wonderful, Amuba.  
It is all mixed here, you see.  
Ameres was silenced, though not convinced.  
"I have heard of them, father.  
"Surely that must be wrong," Chebron said.  
"Are they built of brick or stone?  
Chebron said enthusiastically.  
"Let us slip away," he said.  
Six dogs accompanied them.  
"We will shoot together," Chebron said.  
"It is lovely, is it not?"  
"What are we going to do to-morrow, Rabah?"  
"Many kinds," the man replied.  
But I suppose it is true."  
A fowl is placed in each box.  
"How do you hunt them--on foot?"  
"They must be cowardly beasts!"  
"It is a woman's voice."  
"I don't think she is dead," Amuba said.  
"I dare say she belongs there."  
Jethro entered the cottage.  
They re-entered the cottage.  
"It is well," the old man said.  
What are we going to do to-morrow?"  
"That will I with gladness, my young lord.  
We will see where it leads to."  
"There is the sky overhead.  
Amuba exclaimed, pulling his garment.  
they are giving the alarm.  
In the boat Amense and Mysa were seated.  
Has a deadly snake bit you?  
I will run and fetch a hoe."  
There is no hoping that now."  
Chebron seemed paralyzed at the news.  
Amuba exclaimed, "do not walk like that.  
Ameres waved his hand impatiently.  
In others trees are worshiped.  
"I do not think you should fly, Chebron.  
"That is true," Chebron said thoughtfully.  
Things must go on as they are."  
"Where are you going, Jethro?"  
"He is no more," Jethro said.  
"Follow me, my lord," Chigron said to Chebron.  
"All is here except food," Chigron said.  
My dear father is no more.  
Then I went out to the gate.  
The sacred cat has been slain!'  
There was no time to see more.  
thank the gods you have returned.  
"'I want to speak to Ruth,' I said.  
"This was a new mystery.  
I do not like him myself.  
In many of these there are sarcophagi.  
[Illustration: C. of B.  
"So be it, then," Jethro said.  
The day passed slowly to Chebron and Amuba.  
"I will take another route."  
"Then it was an accident?"  
"And not in your sight, young man?  
Amuba was silent for a moment.  
the noble asked abruptly.  
Do you think that you can walk?"  
"Which way do you want to go?"  
Where is the malefactor?'  
"He started at three o'clock!"  
"Hold out your hands," Jethro said.  
I shall never forget it."  
I scarce know how it was done."  
Mysa was crying bitterly now.  
she cried, "this is too dreadful!"  
"But it is all the same," Mysa cried.  
"I see it was not your fault, Chebron.  
"But I will never marry Plexo!"  
"She wanted me to marry Plexo.  
"I can walk as well as Chebron," Mysa said.  
What will be your terms a week?"  
the lads asked as he entered.  
the water will refresh you."  
"It will be a long time first, Mytis.  
At Syene they remained for three days.  
I certainly heard them then."  
"Why did not Amuba come down with you?"  
Ruth repeated in surprise.  
"We must keep on to the wells.  
The journey was a long one.  
The latter fought steadily.  
I will look after these two."  
They were but one story high.  
"I cannot think so," Amuba replied.  
Midnight was now close at hand.  
Then he with his own band joined Amuba.  
I would do nothing further to-night.

Lead Thou me on"     CHAPTER I.  
"Perhaps--in a sense--who knows!"  
asked Cecile's stepmother.  
"Yes, my dear, when you're dying.  
Now I can talk in comfort.  
"Who's my Aunt Lydia?"  
My own, my own, my darling!  
Still I wasn't really frightened.  
I never got one clew to her.  
The light 'ull come quite fast enough.  
"Ain't you ready, stepmother?"  
_don't_ you know about Jesus?'  
'Why, Jesus is--Jesus is----Oh!  
Jesus loves everybody."  
It do seem nice to hear that.  
"Lovedy," she said, "Lovedy; find Lovedy," and then she died.  
Cecile loved everybody.  
"What is wrong, my little one?"  
But Cecile was different.  
Let me see the other child."  
A GUIDE TO THE PYRENEES.  
And will He come soon, Mistress?"  
She shook her old head and frowned.  
You said as He was a guide.  
There ain't no fear, my dear life.  
"But, Maurice, how do you know?  
You are still a young woman."  
"Yes, child, yes; 'tis all the same."  
he repeated, "I hate you!  
We'll get well through the attics to-day."  
I'm going to lie down.  
"May I lie down on my bed?"  
if you find it don't keep it.  
What thing had happened to her?  
said little Cecile, "the purse!  
she knew her own sister well."  
Now Jane was a Methodist.  
I did not know it was that."  
You lie down and shut your eyes."  
But now knowledge was power.  
"Why, yes, I certainly do.  
"Is there much money in it?"  
I looked out, and I saw--"  "What?"  
"Dear, dear Jane, I do love you.  
Yes, Jane, I'm quite ready.  
that brandy would make her sleep.  
"No, thank you," answered Cecile.  
Now, Maurice, listen to me.  
Tears sprang to her own blue eyes.  
Ha'n't you no home, now, as you sits yere?"  
hasn't we all to do things cheap?  
The girl gave a loud rude laugh.  
"Well, what a bother you ere!  
She came up to the bedside.  
Her father said it lay south.  
The children stood to watch them.  
The door still remained open.  
Yes, I do think He will come."  
Cecile, p'raps that garden is South.  
and will I give it to 'em?  
Have you room for 'em, old girl?"  
That sounds like a boy's name.  
We won't wait for him, honey.  
"It will eat good too, I hope.  
Now, Cecile, why don't you come?"  
she said gently to the child.  
"Then I'll go too," said Maurice.  
This he repeated three times.  
Sometimes He smiles, and is pleased.  
He is just out of prison.  
What was he in prison for?  
I love Jesus; yes, I do.  
I had to tell Jane Parsons.  
Do you _really_ know the way?"  
"Was she older than me, ma'am?  
and was she yer daughter, ma'am?"  
"My heart wor still sore and strange.  
"Why, Cecile, did you know her?"  
THE TRIALS OF SECRECY.  
said the clergyman, laughing.  
Her little heart was at rest.  
But she could do more than that.  
STARTING ON THE GREAT JOURNEY.  
"No, Cecile, you shall not go.  
It's much, much nicer here."  
Why should we go south to-day, Cecile?  
You mark my words, John Moseley."  
Little she knew or recked, poor child!  
"'Twasn't in my 'greement, Maurice, darling.  
The French don't matter, Cecile.  
Still he was a favorite.  
"Well, I rather guess I am.  
said the boy, "Poor little mites!  
"And me too, and Toby too!"  
"I ain't a brute," said the boy.  
"Why, young un, we're going south.  
asked Maurice, "and food to eat?  
I wor werry misribble in Paris.  
Yes, I don't want to stay there.  
I don't know what for to do."  
THE WORD THAT SETTLED JOE BARNES.  
I'm much stronger than you."  
You could not do it, Joe Barnes."  
"But Jesus, the good Guide, does.  
Only it is very sad.  
And now I must go to sleep."  
He set his keen wits to work.  
But now, what had transformed him?  
"I was, Cecile, but 'tis gone.  
"I'm not going to sleep.  
"That one about '_thousands of children_?'"  
"Yes--singing, 'Glory, glory, glory.'"  
What a dreadful position!  
What a terrible danger!  
Then she remembered no more.  
Toby looked hard at Joe Barnes.  
Did not smoke mean a fire?  
How worn her little shoes are!  
"In the morning, my darling.  
Dupois would hear of their leaving them.  
Yes, she must go to the Faubourg St. G----.  
Anton felt inclined to swear.  
Pericard was a genuine French lad.  
He laughed, he whistled, he danced.  
Had he then a shallow heart?  
His greedy old face lit up.  
His object was accomplished.  
Pericard was now of no further use.  
He must follow where she led.  
She is an English lady.  
Will you open the purse, please?  
Her hair was scanty and gray.  
He came last night in a dream.  
I was thought too old-fashioned.  
"What is your name, little girl?"  
Now, Cecile, listen to me.  
"But I have hit on a plan.  
As he smoked, he laid his plans.  
Bad ideas came to him.  
at last they reached the cellars.  
They are to be let next week.  
I'll be back when it grows dark.  
"Maurice will not care to hear.  
But I'll stand up to wot I said.  
CHILDREN'S ARCADIA.  
He was not idle himself.  
He Looked like an English boy.  
How blistered they often were!  
This was the life Maurice loved.  
not so very far away.  
He did not care to wake him.  
"You have got little Maurice?"  
"I must have little Maurice.  
No harm shall happen to him.  
I lay three plans afore you, Joe Barnes.  
You can choose wot one you like best.  
You can get that 'ere purse of gold.  
FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.  
"Werry well, Missie," said Joe.  
Was he prepared to do this?  
how Joe did love his mother!  
for Cecile might never find Lovedy.  
True, he had given his word!  
HARD TIMES FOR LITTLE MAURICE.  
Why did not Anton return?  
"See," he said, "I can walk now.  
You sit down and don't bother."  
Anton laughed derisively.  
Oh, how he longed for Cecile!  
Cecile had strange dreams that night.  
Cecile obeyed him at once.  
"'Anton' I said; and then, Missie, oh!  
How strange her words and manner!  
Why are you going away?  
"No," answered the young woman.  
but I must," answered Cecile.  
I will tell you all I know.  
and the Frenchwoman answered "_La pauvre petite_!"  
He was lost long, long ago.  
I know why he ran away.  
She said the man spoke English.  
I am quite ready at last.'"  
I think that is all, my dear.  
Joe's story is quite true.  
said Suzanne Malet in a faint voice.  
said her husband tenderly.  
A beautiful English girl!  
I went to my Aunt Fanny.  
I would not tell them my tale.  
but she had the kindest heart.  
how the poor were suffering!  
I feels the 'eat, no doubt; but Lor'!  
Jest set the table tidy."

Chapter 18: The Court of Versailles.  
"No, Rupert, you are too hot.  
"I will be very careful.  
"What, Monsieur Dessin, you must be off?  
I have often heard your name.  
exclaimed Colonel Holliday.  
"Ah, I thought so," the earl said.  
"By no means," the earl answered.  
"It shall not be," he burst out.  
"No, Rupert, it won't do, lad.  
I have no right to say aught.  
I will spit the saucy knave!"  
"This is no place for me now.  
exclaimed Colonel Holliday.  
Enough mischief has been done."  
"Two shillings between us, Hugh!  
And it is 126 miles to London.  
"We can't go on with that, sir.  
Put it carefully by, lad.  
Thy own money is in the valise.  
H ow long have you been here?"  
"Only some five minutes, Hugh.  
"No, indeed," Rupert answered.  
"What may be your name, mistress?"  
hurry her down to the boat.'  
"I had no plan," Rupert said.  
It is the fortune of war.  
Then the master dropped his point.  
What was he like, this Monsieur Dessin?"  
And you know him as Monsieur Dessin?  
"We have missed you these two weeks.  
"I will have his life's blood!"  
No, Dillon, it would not do.  
"Do, by all means," Rupert said.  
The party now set to work.  
They rode up to it, and then dismounted.  
"Do you smell anything, Hugh?"  
"It's got to be done, Hugh.  
It was conceit, not madness.  
I will therefore now conclude.  
exclaimed both his companions.  
"He has gone now," Rupert said.  
"There, I see he is ready.  
Goodbye, Master Holliday.  
Rupert was not mistaken.  
If so, let us have a light.  
The other boat had come up.  
"They have taken to the boats."  
Give me that keg of powder."  
I will take hold of the cord.  
Chapter 12: The Sad Side Of War.  
It's a mere waste of time.  
"Stop rowing," he said, in Dutch.  
"I have no idea, Hugh.  
Hugh exclaimed, "I hear a voice."  
"Are you going to Bergen?  
"We are always out of it."  
What a terrible fire!  
"That's right, lads, that's right.  
"Hold my horse, I will soon see."  
The hut proved to be empty.  
Nothing, however, was found.  
His waking was not pleasant.  
"Tell me that you are not killed!"  
Chapter 14: The Riot at Dort.  
It is light, and very strong.  
In two minutes he returned.  
"We must hold this broad staircase.  
They were indeed a grim set.  
Rupert said; "and who was he?  
Chapter 15: The End of a Feud.  
The fellow died hard," Joe Sedley said, cheerily.  
The battle was now over.  
"Did you recognize my name?"  
"No indeed," Rupert answered.  
"It did indeed," Rupert said.  
the two officers exclaimed.  
I did not mention your name.  
Chapter 18: The Court of Versailles.  
Adele will of course be there.  
"I believe you have no heart.  
"And you, Mademoiselle de Pignerolles?  
the Duc de Carolan asked.  
"Oh, dear no," the girl answered.  
Now don't try to tell stories.  
I don't think that is my line.  
"I suppose so," the girl sighed.  
"Surely, sir," Rupert replied.  
"There, do not stop to thank me.  
"No, I thank you," Rupert said.  
Rupert handed him the note.  
"What can you do, my poor boy?"  
There is no time to be lost.  
Oh, if papa were but here."  
Adele asked in great surprise.  
How mysterious you are."  
He has come from my father.  
"It is lighter in the street."  
You are not frightened, I hope?"  
"You are very good, Rupert.  
The man gave a surly growl.  
he said to Rupert one day.  
"It is the 15th of October."  
Hour after hour passed.  
There, nothing could be better!  
Now then, off we go with him.  
Then the stretcher was laid down.  
the miller said cheerily, from his door.  
"I was wounded in Flanders.  
You don't want a man, do you?  
exclaimed the duke, astonished.  
"I fancy so," Rupert said, drily.  
"It is a useful capture.  
Or did you kiss Madame de Maintenon?  
All the rest is plain sailing."  
The fortress held out bravely.  
For two hours the fight raged.  
At last the allies gained ground.  
In a moment the swords crossed!  
Rupert exclaimed, in delight.  
I heard that you had died at Loches."  
First, how is mademoiselle?"  
It will not be long to wait.  
Dillon burst out laughing, too.  
"I will tell you frankly, de Brissac."  
"So be it," the marquis said.  
"Go you in, sir," said Rupert.  
"He who has just ridden by.  
"This is important, Andre.  
"Quite sure," Rupert said, gravely.  
"I see you have changed saddles."  
Rupert dismounted and knocked at the door.  
"I think we shall get through yet."  
"It is you, Maitre Perrot."  
"Have you your cargo on board?"  
"We sail tomorrow morning."  
Two lads ran up from below.  
But they now came up on deck.  
The night was not a dark one.  
"How do those craft sail with yours?"  
This siege cost the allies 5000 men.  
Such was the victory of Malplaquet.

And Master Trench kept his word.  
You ain't skipper _yet_, you know."  
exclaimed a huge black-bearded fellow named  
Grummidge.  
"Nay--I'll have no hand in that."  
You'll join us in that, Grummidge, won't you?  
was shouted by the look-out in stentorian tones.  
Haste ye, if you  
value life."  
said the  
skipper to his son.  
We'll take shelter in its lee."  
A few were composed  
and grave.  
Possibly some of these prayed.  
"Now then, pass along the  
hawser--quick!"  
But the boy hesitated.  
"No, father, you first," he said.  
"Nay, Master Shallowpate, I had neither."  
"Have you, indeed?--in a book!  
"No, I never did, Olly.  
Here he comes, blowin' like a  
porpoise."  
Might is right on  
this island!"  
N-no, it was only a nib--ha!  
At last circumstances favoured them.  
Garnet  
will manage the boy.  
"I believe you are right, Paul.  
Here they resolved to encamp.  
"Ay is it," responded Trench.  
asked  
Oliver eagerly.  
But it does not matter much.  
"And there's a chance, daddy!  
"All three to hit it at once!"  
"But are you quite alone here?"  
Olly needed no urging.  
was the response from the rock.  
But Olly would not let go.  
"Longer than I expected, Goodred.  
It was a wonderful babe!  
exclaimed the captain promptly.  
"We must turn in our tracks!"  
"Where away, Master Hendrick?  
"Where do the deer all come from?"  
"Yes," he added, "it will do.  
"Now look at me," said Hendrick.  
"Remarkably so," said Paul.  
"Now then, up anchor--here goes!"  
and Oliver cried, "Hurrah!"  
"Have  
you reason to fear aught?"  
"But what are we to do, boys?"  
But the warning came too late.  
They did not  
yet understand Grummidge.  
cried Squill, amid hearty laughter.  
"I'm sick tired o' fish.  
That's what I wants to know."  
"Well, Grummidge, what may be your notion?"  
TELLS OF DEATH AND DISASTER.  
Blackboy bounded away in wild haste.  
The struggle was sharp, but short.  
A NEW FRIEND WITH STARTLING NEWS.  
His  
solemnity deepened.  
Again the Indian glared.  
"Does Strongbow think that the frost will hold?"  
Hendrick gave a low whistle.  
Did you obtain him  
from them?"  
"The men must die," said Bearpaw sternly.  
It is just that they should die."  
Perhaps the palefaces did _not_ kill him.  
Do they admit that they  
did?"  
She was not a little child.  
Answer me that question first."  
Howsiver, I'm strong  
enough p'r'aps to die fightin'.  
"So will I," said Little Stubbs.  
There he met Paul and Hendrick.  
Tell your  
paleface friends that Bearpaw has spoken."  
demanded the chief fiercely.  
"But what can I do, Olly?"  
"Well, we might do worse, my son.  
This was received in silence.  
"Has Rising Sun forgotten Bearpaw?"  
Does not Rising Sun know it?  
yes; the palefaces had to do with it.  
They lifted him tenderly.  
He would have cheered, but Grummidge checked him.

HOW THE CURSE BEGAN 5        CHAPTER II.  
SEARCHING FOR A CLUE 273      CHAPTER XVII.  
"Jacob meant nothing by it."  
"In the natural way, sir.  
"What do you mean, Mackenzie?  
That's what you mean, isn't it?"  
I will at some other time.  
Dr. Mackenzie shook his head.  
"What is it, Miss Margaret?"  
"I am better now, father."  
"Here is some tea, dearie," Hesba said, softly.  
Don't talk, dear, and don't worry.  
Your mother will be glad, child.  
At last the latter sauntered away.  
I fancy he has gone now.  
Yes, what you say is quite right.  
he repeated, in low tones.  
"You are mad; impossible!"  
"Good God, who can have done this?"  
Tell Mr. Carne I am here."  
Reginald Carne soon came down.  
"She has been stabbed to the heart."  
I will go up by myself."  
"Quite right," the doctor replied.  
"Please, sir, will you come in here?  
You remember me, don't you?"  
The detective shook his head.  
What should she speak to him for?  
Be steady, lad, be steady.  
the lieutenant repeated, incredulously.  
"What are you saying, doctor?  
She was lying on her side."  
His dogcart met me at the station.  
Here he paused for a minute.  
I mounted and rode away.  
I don't think we need go in."  
"Very well," Mr. Gulston replied.  
"How are you feeling now, Ruth?  
However, I must be off.  
A dark night in November.  
You are as white as death, child.  
The foreman hesitated.  
"But why did you feel sure, Ruth?"  
"Infantry or cavalry?"  
"I enlist as Harry Blunt.  
"When can you let me have them?"  
He came out when Ronald knocked.  
"Do you feel equal to it?"  
"What a soldierly-looking young fellow he is!  
Very well, we pass the horse."  
Well, we shall see about that.  
She drew rein when she reached them.  
"Do not be too sure of that.  
The force moved in three columns.  
And now what is your next news?"  
Don't all fire together.  
"So we were, sir," Ronald said.  
"Yes, that is so," Ronald said.  
"I made sure they were all gone.  
The 91st will fall back directly.  
he asked one of the troopers.  
"I meant no offence," the recruit said.  
"He will do now," Ronald said.  
What's to be done, sergeant?"  
"How many men will you take, Kreta?"  
"What are they going back for?"  
"How far is it to these fords?"  
"Do you know the Amatolas at all, chief?"  
"Where shall we stay till morning?"  
"Girl got to Macomo's kraal," the chief said.  
"All the better," Ronald said.  
They had passed through several kraals.  
"Did he see the young lady?"  
That was all he could tell him.  
"How soon can we go on, chief?"  
Ronald asked, impatiently.  
Keep your eyes always on ground.  
"No, no guards have been placed there.  
"Well, now, incos, what are we to do?"  
Kreta agreed in this opinion.  
"It will be getting light soon.  
"How can I thank you enough?"  
she said, when he had finished.  
"Here are some mealies and some cold meat.  
Then he came up to Ronald.  
"It is time we were going."  
The chief now gave a loud call.  
"Of course I can," she replied.  
"But they might overtake you, Kreta."  
"We run fast and get good start.  
Now let us join the others.  
"Have you heard from my father?  
"I can go to him, I hope?"  
They have carried off Mary.  
"What, the girl who was rescued?"  
Of course the verandah outside shades you.  
The man turned savagely round.  
"Oh, it's you, Sergeant Blunt?  
Who is this man, I wonder?  
"What time do you march to-morrow, Ronald?"  
I know what these dunderheaded police are.  
"Yes, custom is everything.  
"Well, father, what is your news?"  
She may have moved a little.  
"How can you say so, father?"  
Nothing is too bad for him.'  
Well, we shall see; we shall see.  
She found her quiet and pale.  
"Oh, Mary, how terrible!"  
Was he married before, then?"  
I can clear him, and I will."  
"My love seemed to have been killed.  
It has been dreadful," she said, wanly.  
"You cannot tell how dreadful.  
"I thank God for that, Mary.  
Mr. Armstrong said, quickly.  
"Yes, that's partly it, lad.  
"That's the story, my lad.  
The officer at once rose.  
"No evidence, you villain?"  
The man staggered as if struck.  
But Ronald did not hear him.  
There is no time to be lost.  
He can clear me if he will.  
"Will you write down what he says?"  
That's all I have to say."  
"I know nothing about that.  
THE FIRE AT CARNE'S HOLD.  
A month was spent in London, sight-seeing.  
"Well, what is the news, neighbours?"  
"He must be got back," he said.  
"How about those in the house?"  
"I thought it was," the smith said.  
The gardener was speaking.  
You can come down safe enough."  
He spoke to one of the grooms.  
"Have you got plenty of rope?"  
"What is to be done, doctor?"  
There could be no doubt of that.  
"Not of Carne's Hold, thank God!"  
the girl said with a shudder.  
"Do you know me, Reginald?"  
I cheated you all nicely."  
Didn't I do it cleverly, Volkes?  
"Do you believe this story?"  
"But the man was mad, doctor."  
"Yes, he died at two o'clock.  
Ruth gave a start and a cry.  
Mr. Volkes asked, in some surprise.  
Mary said, as she entered.  
"I have, indeed," Ruth replied.  
"I could not, father," she sobbed.

Down went his second finger.  
"But had he got the money?"  
"Who's disagreeable?"  
"No, no, don't go, Bob," I cried.  
"Oh, all right then," said Bigley.  
What does he know about it?"  
"Oh, I dunno; don't bother!"  
"What did you fetch the rope for?"  
Where's the use o' stopping?  
"I've got the rope and the bar."  
"I say, Big, is that rope strong?"  
I'm getting hungry now."  
"Oh, I say, don't," he panted.  
"Oh, I say, Bob, your boot-toe is hard."  
"No, no," I said; "that isn't right."  
"Can't hurt anything, can it?"  
"I haven't got the bar quite right.  
Come and catch hold of the bar.  
"Never mind the buckle, lad.  
Let's send this stone over.  
"No, because you don't half try."  
said Bob contemptuously.  
"A big _bom boom_," said Bigley.  
He don't take any notice."  
You want to fall out, but I sha'n't.  
"It must be off directly."  
"Why didn't you say so sooner?"  
I'm hot yet with climbing."  
Well, what's to be done now?"  
"Well, I thought it was then, old clever-shakes.  
"But it seems such a pity!"  
"So you've come home from school, eh?"  
"What am I talking about?  
I bought some at Squire Allworth's sale."  
Just as if it was likely!"  
"When he says `no' he means it.  
"They'll all go out through the holes.  
"There are no fish there at all.  
Never mind, I'll serve you out."  
Did you ever see such a babby?"  
"Do you want me to thrash you?"  
"I didn't, did I, Sep Duncan?  
Here, what are you grinning at?"  
"I don't believe it," he said impetuously.  
"You two chaps are visitors.  
You come and try, Sep Duncan.  
"Why, you knew that all along!"  
"Then what makes you so quiet?"  
Somebody must have dropped it."  
"Yes, father," I said slowly.  
"I'm afraid so, father."  
he exclaimed as I ended.  
Well, don't do so any more."  
"Place them in your pocket, boy."  
Your eyes are better than mine.  
There's a man watching us."  
"Yes, I see, father," I cried.  
That's right," said the doctor.  
"No," said my father smiling.  
"What's a crucible, sir?"  
We must wait till it cools down.  
THE RESULT OF THE SMELTING.  
"Well, I think quite differently.  
"Oh, come, that is a good one."  
He started off to walk to Barnstaple."  
"Only show the stuff," I said.  
"Duncan, what a man you are!"  
Don't talk stuff," was the answer.  
we both shouted, and then "Yes!"  
"Well, that's something," said Bob.  
"No," he shouted, "on the right."  
"Well, can't you find any more?"  
Then I uttered a loud "Ugh!"  
"Well, why don't you pull it out?"  
"Think there's anything else?"  
You won't frighten me again."  
"I say, it is deep," he said.  
"Oh, I don't know," he panted.  
said Bob, "there are no big ones."  
"That felt just like a large one."  
Bob Chowne never meant to go in.  
"I've got mine and old Big's."  
"Can't you get any farther?"  
"I wonder how long she'll be?"  
Was I a gull or myself?  
Oh, I say, where are the prawns?"  
There's your father's lugger, Big.  
Let them come and take us off."  
Get your arm well under him.  
We wanted to get to shore."  
"No more do I," he snarled.  
"'Cross the sea to Ireland, eh?  
And no biscuit and water.  
exclaimed the doctor grimly.  
"This, my lad," he continued.  
"Not understand me, my lad!  
Why, I spoke plainly enough.  
"I never saw such a chap.  
Has your father locked them up?"  
Oh, I say, you do look rum!"  
"You wouldn't like me to be hurt."  
"I say, what chaps you two are!"  
Go and fall out with old Bob Chowne."  
"Why, what's the matter, Bob?"  
"You'll come on to-morrow," he said quickly.  
"I hope so, boy, for your sake.  
"Is it all like this, father?"  
WE HAVE A LITTLE FISHING.  
"They've gone across to Swansea, my dear.  
"There's a Molly for you!"  
I say, what a weight you are!  
Let's put him ashore, Sep.  
"Heave over the anchor then!"  
"It's a flat-fish, and a big one."  
"I say, that was near," he cried.  
We could not talk for the wind.  
"I'm not very tired."  
"I want to lie down and sleep.  
"We're close home; there's the light."  
"No," he said; "it's moving.  
We shall get across all right."  
Blown off the shore, sir," I cried.  
"Blown off shore, sir, in the squall."  
"Yes, sir; I belong to him.  
Not like your papa--oh, no.  
I know him mosh, very mosh.  
"No, sir, last night," said Bigley.  
How zey are very mosh hunger.  
Oh, if you please," cried Bigley.  
"But do you know the Gap, sir?"  
I nodded rather grimly.  
"Yes, but how dirty they were!"  
"He has been hauling new ropes.  
But I sha'n't; I don't want to fight.  
"You better well, mosh better.  
I make you jolly boys, eh?"  
"Let's get ashore," he said.  
Get her fast to the buoy."  
"You must drink a glass with him.  
I won't poison you this time."  
"You have saved my boy's life.  
Pauvre fellow, you cold--you hoongrai--you starve youselfs.'  
"HOW YOU HAVE GROWED, LADS; HOW YOU HAVE GROWED!"  
How you have growed, lads; how you have growed!"  
And then, "No, it's too loud."  
Eh, but there is: lots, my lad."  
Never mind, it don't matter.  
"Yes, Sam, when I'm rested.  
he said emphatically.  
Just going to run her off."  
"Well, my lads, what's it like?"  
"That's what the people say.  
Oh, everybody says so.  
"Only young Uggleston, father," I said.  
"Yes, father," I said sadly.  
I thought directly after.  
There is a screw-driver in that cupboard."  
"You can lay the things out here.  
"You'd better unpack," he said.  
cried Bigley excitedly.  
"What are you thinking about?"  
"I don't think it would be right.  
"Father didn't say I was to."  
"Wonder whether they're scarlet?"  
We can think what's inside.  
"Why, we haven't seen any belts."  
"Because it's the best way.  
"To be sure," said my father.  
Let me look at that pistol, Uggleston."  
"Why, what's the matter, Sep?"  
I said, feeling quite abashed.  
"What, about a uniform?"  
"No," I said; "have the French come?"  
What are you going to do?"  
I s'pose that's a French boat too!"  
"I don't care what people say."  
Has your father come back, Sep?"  
"He'll be back soon, I expect."  
Now he's at it again."  
"Come on down and meet father."  
"Now that ought to make muscle.  
Your hands will be unsteady."  
"What are you going to do?"  
"Didn't you hear me hail before?"  
No, it couldn't have been those rocks."  
he said, pointing to the east.  
"Never mind," he said sharply.  
"Yes, I see," said my father.  
"Boat," said Bob decidedly.  
Here, Bigley, sit up, my lad!  
said Bob, looking rather white.  
Here, jump up, and ride on first.  
Then we shall see where you fall."  
"I said you'd come back all right.  
"I shall have to speak at once.  
"There, Uggleston, you have betrayed yourself."  
Kindly step on board the boat.  
"What are you doing that for?"  
"Never mind that, Big," I cried.  
"Oh, I wish I was aboard."  
Now, then, what did I tell you?  
"I sha'n't eat if you don't," he said.  
cried Bigley excitedly.  
"Now, Bigley, no snivelling--be a man!  
"How came he back again, Big?"  
"Was it the _Hirondelle_ we saw last night!"  
"Yes," said Bob, "we were all there."  
"Yes," said Bob Chowne; "that's the hole."  
cried my father haughtily.  
"Come and search again, my lads."  
"Mine," said my father promptly.  
"If he had said, `who lives there?'  
He can come down safely now."  
said my father angrily.  
he cried, as he rolled about.  
I say, Big, you were frightened."  
"I know," I said suddenly.  
cried Bigley excitedly.  
"I am sure of it, my boy.  
"What shall you do then, father?"  
"Oh, there you are, then," he said good-humouredly.  
"Sell it then, father," I said.  
"No," he said smiling; "no, Sep.  
said my father thoughtfully.  
"I'm tired too," I said.  
"I've been walking a good way to-day.  
"The women and children gone?"  
Can you show us to ze Ripplemouts towns?"  
You'll find the wickets handy.  
"That's good," said my father.  
They don't want loading again.  
"One shot can't have scared them off.  
"So it is," whispered Bigley.  
"What are they going to do?"  
The men there are sure to run.  
I obeyed him exactly.  
"Sit down, my lads, anywhere.  
"Only a bit of a cut!"  
said my father with a groan.  
"Yes, but only in the leg.  
"What are you going to do?"  
said the man innocently.  
I fear they know where to look."  
And what he must be feeling.  
A good-sized French man-of-war must be off the Gap."  
"No, I couldn't walk," he replied.  
"I can hardly get down here."  
I said, "how well they all fought!"  
Why, lad, what's the matter?"  
They must have seen the fires."  
"I'm sure of it," I cried.  
"Sep, can you get over there?"  
"Well, is anybody killed?"  
"Here, Bob, bandages, scissors.  
"Yes," said Doctor Chowne, "on his coat.  
"Been a regular fight, then?"  
"No, I'll go," said the doctor.  
"Mother Bonnet, you're a queen!"  
Sir, I'm proud to know you."  
If there are no spars bring the sweeps."  
said the officer sharply.  
cried my father angrily.  
It's of no use to you.  
BIGLEY FEELS HIS POSITION.  
"I've told you before, my lad.  
cried Bob Chowne, "let the doctor come."  
Here, help me run the boat down."  
"You can't dive down three fathoms?"  
"I'm going to show you.  
I exclaimed, "I came to bathe."  
"What did I do it for, Sep?"  
"Box covered with sea-weed," I replied.  
"_One of my father's what_?"  
"What, the one with the silver?"  
Here, what shall we do, Bigley?  
"Big," I said dolefully; "we've come too late.  
A man can walk down a horse.  
"No, I said; it will not do.  
"He ought to come back, eh, Big?"  
"But if anything happened?"  
"Why, nothing can happen, sir.  
cried my father eagerly.

THE REPULSE OF THE NORSEMEN  XV.  
It is dull work here alone.  
do you hear them, old fellow?"  
At last he approached Egbert.  
"I pray you rise," the king said.  
The Saxon fleet kept the sea.  
The Danes fought desperately.  
The Saxons did not pursue.  
"Let us run up thither," Edmund said.  
that may be so," the jarl replied.  
The bag was again shaken.  
Edmund's duties were light.  
"A Saxon slave," he answered.  
Freda asked in tones of surprise.  
"What has disturbed you, father?"  
This was of course agreed to.  
So saying she left the tent.  
The combat was a long one.  
"Is that a promise, Edmund?"  
"Yes, Freda, a solemn promise."  
It was a gloomy journey.  
You are worse than useless here.  
"You were not asleep, you say?  
Their names have come down to us.  
A desperate battle ensued.  
"Is it really you, Edmund?"  
"Shall I go with you, Edmund?"  
"Sweyn has a good eye for a boat."  
Freda did not answer at once.  
It is an unfortunate mischance."  
Sweyn had other objects in view.  
"Just in time," Edmund replied.  
At nightfall they dropped anchor.  
Then she stood still and silent.  
"So much the better," Siegbert exclaimed.  
Sweyn fell on the deck with a crash.  
The Dragon returned to Rome.

Who can describe that meeting?  
Won't you be 'ad up before  
the beaks?  
It'll be a case o' murder."  
Yet not altogether safe.  
"Come in: I have news for you.  
You remember him, don't you?"  
"But all is not ended, Bob.  
"Agreed," said his companions.  
"Because it's comin' on to plow.  
Another  
biscuit, Barret."  
"I should like to 'ave know'd that old gurl!"  
whispered his friend in reply.  
But we'll see whan it comes clear."  
cried Mabberly, in rising  
excitement.  
"He's only stunned, I think."  
"Is there any one inside?"  
But where have you  
come from, sir?  
I don't belong to this place.  
He lives near the heed o' Loch Lossie.  
asked Mabberly, referring to the raft.  
Weel, weel, but it iss a strange contrivance!"  
Now it  
is time to turn in.  
"Now, Barret, have you finished?"  
"Oh for Giles, with his rifle!"  
His efforts were successful.  
Fishers always do, you  
know!  
He's photographing them!"  
My dear, what have you got there?"  
said the laird,  
interrupting.  
PLANS, PROSPECTS, AND A GREAT FIGHT.  
Junkie, did you hear the gong?"  
"It is beautifully painted.  
But I'm bad--_awful_ bad!  
for nobody else at all?"  
My house is `liberty hall.'  
"How is Milly this morning?"  
What do you intend to do?"  
"D'ee know how to fish for salmon?"  
"A lie," said Junkie, promptly.  
"Sure, and that _was_ a cracker!"  
"Did Ivor say it was true?"  
"That's often the way--no!--th-there!  
There are plenty more of them.  
Has it given  
you much pain?"  
But Shames said something to  
_me_, what-e-ver."  
People always do thus  
fail.  
"I'll show you  
zat after lunch too."  
"Good-day, Mrs  
Anderson; good-day, Aggy.  
He'll git a lang shot at them there.  
"That iss so--what-e-ver," returned the seaman.  
See; it is  
empty just now.  
"Now, then, I will load it thus.  
"You don't require to know.  
"But they're a long way off, sor."  
cried the captain, anxiously.  
Chand  
Moorut was held back in reserve.  
However, we can try it.  
Come now, lads,  
we'll be going."  
Another was ambition.  
His Christian name was Richard.  
"Didn't I bid ye hau'd your tongue?"  
See that ye make no noise, now.  
And Junkie's glengarry!  
"What's to be done noo, Junkie?"  
"Looks like it," returned his friend drily.  
The bank was not regular.  
"This is most remarkable.  
Donald went off like a shot.  
It was a glorious chance.  
Lots of grub left yet, you see."  
"Never mind, that'll do no harm.  
"Na, ye'd better let him lie.  
He was a  
terrible sight.  
"What makes you think so, Ian?"  
said Milly with energy.  
Is she likely to stay long?"  
"Yes, sir, it iss akward," said the elder.  
Are ye ready wi' the halyards, Muster Airchie?"  
He was a splendid swimmer.  
asked Milly when he was gone.  
"Here's the water, Milly.  
Perhaps  
the rocks may hide them.  
There iss no hope for him, I fear."  
Wasn't it generous of him?  
MacRummle was wonderfully patient.  
I'll soon contrive a litter."  
And she did not disapprove."  
"Indeed--indeed I am not."  
"Again I say I am _not_.  
I am the man--the coward."  
What was the surprise about?  
"Why do you laugh so much, child?"  
asked Milly in some surprise.  
"I know it well, dear mother!"  
"No, and he never will come!"  
asked Mrs Moss, in surprise.  
And it did so tickle them!  
"`Richard's himself again!'  
At present we  
state a fact.  
The matchlock-men tried in vain to check him.  
It was a tremendous sight.  
The  
rogue stopped short instantly.  
The effect was terrific.  
"Only he added,  
`Musha!'  
"I wonder," said he, "what _that_ wull pe!"  
"Don't you smell a smell, Tonal'?"  
"Mother and Flo are safe, boys.  
"I'll go for the photographs!  
Archie was indeed "takin'" the  
house!  
Off with you, an' get to sleep!"  
"Are ye laughing, you rascals?"  
But the keeper did not move.  
exclaimed Jackman, fervently.  
"You are right, sir; it was not.  
You soon found another key!"  
The days an' nights of torment!  
"I am very glad she did!"  
So now I have kept my word.  
But  
I think little o' that.  

## thefifthformatstdominics.txt  

shrieked one little treble voice.  
"I know who you are, you cads.  
"Well, why don't you, you avaricious young Jew?  
No Tadpoles or Guinea-pigs need apply.  
"Won't they be in a fury?  
"Yes, I suppose so; and you?"  
"Good-Bye, my boy; God bless you!  
Bring it to me in my room.  
I have to go back with Wren.  
"Only when I wash my face.  
Those Guinea-pigs are beyond all patience.  
I'm awfully sorry."  
A MORNING WITH A TADPOLE.  
that wretched Tenth Fiji War.  
There was no one to help him.  
as he caught sight of Stephen.  
I would cry if I were you.  
"Silence, young gentleman, pray!"  
Pembury meanwhile returned to Stephen.  
"_However_ am I to know?"  
murmured Stephen, in despair.  
Oh, dear, I shall _never_ pass!"  
They are all too hard for me.  
Master Paul looked sharply round.  
Who are you for, A or Z?"  
"Which of you is young Greenfield?"  
"I am," said Stephen, promptly.  
However, it couldn't be helped.  
"I never stole anything!"  
"No," said Stephen, half choking.  
Why, what's the row, youngster?"  
"Greenfield junior, where are you?"  
Then the Doctor rang his bell.  
"Yes, but the Doctor said half-past nine.  
"Calm yourself, my young friend," said Pembury.  
"Oh, don't apologise," laughed Pembury.  
"Not at all, my dear fellow.  
"What on earth have you got there?"  
exclaimed Greenfield and his friend.  
like the policemen," added Wraysford.  
"I can't help it," said Stephen.  
and how are you getting on?  
Of all things he liked boating.  
Well, I don't know exactly.  
I don't want a rotten one."  
May be 2 pounds or 3 pounds, or so."  
"Not at all, young gentleman.  
Well, good-day, Mr-- what's your name?"  
and ask him what the price is."  
My eye, it's a prime bat!  
Everything succeeded well.  
Then, too, they all oiled their hair.  
How I would like to hug her!  
It makes a crowd--too much row.  
said Oliver, with a drawl.  
Wraysford walked hastily to the door.  
Do you know this gentleman?  
This was not satisfactory.  
"I suppose you _will_ fight him?"  
replied Oliver, briefly.  
Is that you, Mr Braddy?  
The next man in was Loman.  
"Yes; did Mr Cripps send it?"  
What is the price of the bat?"  
He says it's a beauty!  
and looked uncomfortable.  
"What do I care what they think?"  
said Wraysford, good-humouredly; "I quite agree with you.  
Other boys went up and down.  
You'll soon get to feel at home.  
kindly inquired Mr Rastle.  
Much better do it yourself.  
Have another cup of tea?"  
he gasped, as they flew along.  
"Had up before the Doctor?  
Come on to the meeting; quick!"  
Do you take me for a fool?"  
not a penny for my pains!  
"Please, I want to know the price."  
_I_ can struggle on somehow."  
"I shall have to send it back.  
"Hullo, Loman, I say, is that you?"  
Yet this seemed his only hope.  
THE "DOMINICAN" AGAIN.  
"What on earth am I to do?"  
It's all humbug, I know!  
"And you'll get it, too; rather!  
Perhaps that is the reason.  
The "dogs of war" were let loose!  
They would be revenged on somebody!  
This is very well written.  
The last is really funny.  
Still Stephen hesitated.  
the stall was closed for the day.  
looking for lollipops, eh?"  
"I say," said he, "is this a public-house?"  
Now, I guess you like ginger-beer, don't you?"  
"Here you are, young governor.  
"Good-bye, my fine young fellow.  
That's why I fancy you.  
My love to Mr Loman."  
How easy the first wrong step!  
"Loman; he's sprained his wrist."  
"Have you shown it to Dr Splints?"  
"Why, it's Mr Loman!  
he exclaimed, in a rapture.  
"Afraid it won't do, mister."  
"Oh, but I'm _sure_ to be.  
They are sure to be licked now.  
"Well, that _is_ a piece of luck!"  
How the small boys yelled at this!  
"No more do I," said Stephen.  
All this while the Fifth were in ecstasies.  
"I hope _you'll_ get half as much.  
But happily they were not.  
retorted Stephen, fiercely.  
"Look here, you lame little wretch!"  
A LOWER SCHOOL FESTIVAL.  
Haven't you got the English prize?  
What good have I been to him?  
"No more I do, in a way.  
But it's desperate hard work."  
"Whatever's up down there?"  
I saw you do it this time!  
"Let's stick all together.  
"What a young ruffian your brother is!"  
"Then you'll have to interfere."  
He's a proud little chap."  
Discipline must be maintained."  
He pushed; it was fortified.  
said Loman shutting the door.  
It struck him hard on the cheek.  
"Did you shake hands afterwards?"  
There was no making him out.  
He looked up and saw Mr Rastle.  
You had better get to bed."  
The Doctor never said so.  
"English literature, sir."  
"What have the boys been reading?"  
This was a little too much.  
The Doctor did not spare him.  
It came to an end at last.  
"Has any one perused it?"  
"Certainly not," said Mr Jellicott.  
A HOLIDAY ADVENTURE.  
exclaimed Loman, horrified.  
"I say, Cripps, you mustn't do that.  
"Eh!--what ain't he been saying!  
I say, it will be a spree."  
Stephen did as he was bid.  
Then the truth dawned upon him.  
"Monitor's room, indeed!"  
"Kick open the door, can't you?"  
They had their fling undisturbed.  
"What's a jolly good job?"  
exclaimed Bramble in a rage.  
Padger peeped through the door, and saw you.  
won't I kick-up a shine about it!  
"They're not far short of that now.  
"What a humbug you are, Wray!  
"Just what I had been thinking.  
"But the Nightingale, I say?"  
I say, don't let them beat you!  
I hope they get drowned; don't you, Padger?"  
Hope you get drowned, do you hear!  
after which he went his way.  
The contest was short and sharp.  
I'll tell you all about it.  
_I'll_ let them know, my beauties!  
THE FIGHT THAT DID NOT COME OFF.  
"Don't you see I'm working?"  
He says because he doesn't choose."  
A fight between Fifth and Sixth!  
"No one wants you here; do we, Padger?  
At the door they met Stephen.  
"Where's the fight, young Greenfield?"  
"Has your brother funked it again?"  
retorted the young brother.  
I think I shall go to bed."  
Should he pay off the score now?  
"If he does I'll make that square.  
"I really wouldn't kick-up shines," said he, imploringly.  
"You'd be a queer Guinea-pig if you didn't!"  
was the flattering answer.  
Stephen was a sobered boy.  
"All very well," said Bramble.  
"Oh, yes, I dare say, don't you, Padger?  
said Stephen, indignantly.  
"Who's going to funk it?"  
I wish it was all over!"  
"Went in for what sort of thing?"  
"You're a liar to say so!"  
who cares for your promises?  
There was just one hope Wraysford clung to.  
It didn't look like losing, this.  
As for that fool Simon--"  "Bah!"  
Wraysford said nothing, but fidgeted in his chair.  
once more exclaimed Bullinger.  
"That's just the worst of it.  
All these things he took unmoved.  
The Doctor began to speak.  
"The Nightingale Scholarship."  
A dead silence followed this eulogium.  
But _I_ won't cut you, you know.  
said Oliver, angrily.  
"Oh; it's not that, you know.  
said Loman, impatiently.  
he exclaimed in amazement.  
"Half a minute," said Loman.  
The two Sixth boys looked at him inquiringly.  
Was it found, or lost, or what?"  
It wasn't much use as it was."  
"Oh, of course I'll keep them, Cripps.  
I haven't as much in the world!"  
"I've just got a note from home to-day."  
How long do you say--two months?"  
Finally it was settled.  
"_I'll_ let them know, if _you_ won't!"  
"Surely _you_ don't believe it?"  
"Do you hear what I tell you?"  
Who stole the exam paper?  
"Shut up, you young cad, will you?"  
"So will I," said another.  
said Paul, "the whole lot of us!  
So none of your humbug, Rick.  
"Yes, you are a thing, isn't he, Padger?  
"Yah, boo, old `_its_,' both of you."  
So Oliver read it out.  
Oliver laughed bitterly.  
"That _would_ be a treat for her!"  
It won't do a bit of good."  
"I can't help that, if they do.  
"Oh, this is a drop too much!  
They had hard work to do it.  
"Oh, no, we can't," said Stansfield.  
The Saturday came at last.  
Whatever had brought Cripps there?  
Stansfield signalled to Loman.  
He only runs a short way.  
You know Tommy Granger here?  
_I_ can tear myself away.  
Was this his luck, after all?  
It was a great occasion.  
"First Latin--Greenfield junior."  
English history--(applause)--Pembury."  
Hadn't he got the Nightingale?  
and wasn't that enough for one half-year?  
Oliver laughed loud at this.  
"I'm not so very sure.  
"Why didn't he send it by post?"  
He looks a nice sort of boy!"  
Do you mean Morris's boy?"  
A new boy of Morris's."  
Well, I shouldn't have interfered.  
What's the fellow's name?"  
He was asking after you.  
Do I go often, Loman?  
"No, Cripps, I haven't," said the boy.  
I'm so miserable!"  
"Give us just a week more," he entreated.  
"Nor can I," said Bullinger.  
"Why, whatever do you mean?"  
Was it peace, or war, or what?  
I've been swindled too--by Cripps.  
Do lend it me, please, Greenfield.  
THE "DOMINICAN" COMES ROUND.  
"Yes, who did take the paper?  
_I_ shall not play if he does.  
"Shall _you_ play if Greenfield does?"  
This was abominable!  
exclaimed Paul, in dire contempt.  
"Oh, yes, he would, though, wouldn't he, Padger?  
But why is Loman resigned?  
And then your lessons are `done.'"  
A STARTLING DISCOVERY.  
"What do you want the bill for?"  
Tell the governor, indeed!  
cried the excited Loman.  
Would you fetch it, Loman, please?  
Turn to the Fifth Satire."  
"Hand me that paper, Loman!"  
THE MATCH AGAINST THE COUNTY.  
"All the boys suspected him."  
Did Greenfield deny the charge?"  
"Yes; you can go now, Loman."  
He came out so very low."  
thundered Stansfield at the door.  
The fellow is like an eel.  
Stansfield's got him at last!  
Greenfield has got him at last.  
And while we speak here it comes.  
Oliver wants no bidding.  
He rushes at Oliver.  
Oliver rushes at him.  
"Masters half price," suggested Padger.  
He wouldn't miss it for a five-pound note."  
"I don't like it at all," said Wraysford.  
But I'm sorry for him.  
"I've forgotten the first line."  
What's become of the chair?"  
"Yes, sir," answered Oliver.  
"Are you and Loman great friends?"  
And did you lend him the pound?"  
"But he has paid you something?"  
The school was strangely silent.  
It was a dreary prospect.  
No one else said anything.  
This was enough for Stephen.  
I'm positive of it!"  
said the boy, plunging forward.  
What ages those seconds seemed!  
Once more, as they turned, a shout!  
Hold up, old boy; we're just there."  
"You know I stole that paper?"  
"So it is," replies Stephen.

the left, it went sheer down.  
"Will it bear our weight, lad?"  
"But now, what are we to do?  
Try if you can wriggle in."  
"Ay, I heard it sure enough.  
But no foe was to be seen!

"Beef, marrow-bones, and rice," replied the man.  
"Couldn't we shorten it a bit?"

It was known that Andrianivo favoured the Christians.

We must arrange for her a

"If de _ody_ was

As if we did not know that!  
"Yes, truly, he believed it.

"What in all the world is he doin'?"  
"Don't your people smoke at all?"  
"That's 'cause I hain't got baccy nor pipe.

silence.  
I not keep in de background!  
Dis is what I's a-gwine to do.  
He could perceive

Perhaps it was Mark

"In the earth," answered the guide.  
where are those thus doomed to die?  
where are those thus doom'd to die?"  
"Lucky I's used to it."  
But you are all well, I hope?"  
"No, it is not well with her.  
It is  
well to be cautious.  
Didn't he tell us to keep close?"  
"But what are we to do now?"  
"He's a born actor," said Hockins.  
interrupted Ravonino, anxiously.  
"You will spend the night with me?"  
"We will be careful," said Mark.  
Gib us your flipper, old boy!"  
"Them be officers too," said Laihova.  
Let  
him do what he pleases.  
"He is my son, I tell you.  
she asked, with a fierce look at Rainiharo.  
I have just heard of it from Rainiharo.  
"No, Rakota, I will not recall it.  
They are even  
now in the market-place.  
You cannot  
fail to know it."  
These men shall be arrested.  
and hastily left the room.  
"An' doesn't I hear cackling?"  
"Why this secrecy, my friend?"  
asked Laihova, in the native language.  
"They know you to  
be a spy.  
Beside him stood our  
friend Ravonino.  
"Are not all here to-night our  
friends?"  
"I think not," returned the man.  
asked the latter,  
anxiously.  
"And was the plan successful?"  
And you have brought me the list?"  
"What d'ee think they'll do to us, sir?"  
One was tall and very dark.  
I hope it is  
well with you.  
"And you have arrived safely?  
What go you to the coast for?"  
I shall be glad to help you.  
There were dangers in the way.  
I left my old mother there.  
They  
are in my hands just now."  
"Will you not show them to me?  
I must do my  
best to succour them.  
I am in the hands of God."  
For  
them, too, there is no fear.  
Sure enough it was  
open.  
"Me too," remarked the negro.  
Come, I go show you your house."  
"Why she not send one for _me_?"  
let us fly now--this moment.  
"It is true--all true," she said.  
Fetch it and read it to me."  
I am not a sovereign that deceives.  
`Follow the Christian customs!'  
"What would you do, Ebony?"  
That fate was not long delayed.  
was  
distinct and decisive.  
"But how am I to escape?  
To die he would _rather_ not!  
He would refuse to answer.  
demanded the Queen sternly.  
He was a strong sturdy pugnacious-looking man.  
His heart was  
almost broken.  
Ebony called it a "dodge."  
The risk will not be increased."  
demanded Ranavalona,  
still angrily.  
One of these slaves is my  
friend.  
Now, here is my little plan.  
Well, I have taught them  
a wild war-dance.  
Let's do it sedately."  
Make them chase you if you can.  
The girl was intelligent.  
"But the Queen is so cruel!"  
objected her little friend.  
Where there is life there is hope!  
"Or make him good," suggested Voalavo.  
Arm, and make to the rescue!  
We will  
dethrone the Queen--this Ranavalona--usurper!  
"Did not Christian  
use a sword?  
"Nay, mother, do not think thus.  
"Oh, massa, p'r'aps dey're a-goin' to kill you!"  
Young crocodiles  
are masticating my--oh!"  
"Something of the sort, no doubt.  
The seaman was  
obliging.  
But science, dat put 'im all right!  
There is one not far from here."  
asked Mark with some interest.  
Is not this a voice, from God?  
Plenty fun an' lots  
ob science!  
Next came a group  
of women.  
"No, I did not dare to ask.  
But they won't kill _you_, sir, or  
Hockins.  
While life remains there is hope!"  
demanded Hater of Lies.  
"No," answered the girl, firmly.  
I, too, am a praying man.  
He did not wait to explain.  
Carry your  
comrades with you!"  
asked the negro, hopefully.  
Have they not told you the news?"  
These were the  
partisans of Rambosalama.  
"Ain't  
my black darlin' awaitin' ob me dar?"  
There is Breetish ship loading at Tamatave now.  
We have no right to judge him.

Need we enlarge on this point?  
You are not like other men.  
They think little and eat much."  
asked the giant, abruptly.  
"No; let us stay and behold!"  
"Yes, stay and see," said Eemerk sternly.  
"The white men do not paddle.  
"And turns its side to us," said Akeetolik.  
"And wags its tail no more," cried Oolichuk.  
"No, no, we will not run," said Tekkona.  
shouted Eemerk, "you want to kill us.  
Does it eat fire and  
smoke?"  
It has a tail, and wags it."  
Why came you to me alone?"  
I'll try to get into it.  
It turned out to be as Butterface said.  
asked the Captain of the mate.  
At last one stepped to the front.  
"Good, that sounds well," said Leo.  
The door was a curtain of sealskin.  
They are very young and wise.  
Only a snap resulted.  
They  
must be led like children.  
"Not a bad suggestion, lad.  
We will encamp here, Anders.  
You will come along with him."  
"The wonderful works of God!"  
"Beautiful, beyond belief!"  
He pointed to the eastward.  
"What d'ye think o' that, father?"  
But these did not  
stand thus long.  
asked Leo, during a pause.  
Captain Vane made no reply.  
Anders and Butterface stood still,--speechless.  
"Can it be part of Greenland?"  
How sad the knowledge makes me!  
asked Captain Vane anxiously.  
You's hard to please, massa.  
A SKETCHER IN IMMINENT DANGER.  
Could  
this be another bear?  
The result was  
stupendous!  
However, we mustn't lose heart.  
After that no more go on.  
"He speaks in riddles, Anders.  
"Are you sure of what you say, Chingatok?"  
"What does Blackbeard mean by coming here?"  
asked Benjy with a pert look.  
I guessed as much," exclaimed Alf.  
I'll unpack them  
presently.  
Nevertheless we will try."  
"How about a tail, father?"  
Alf did as he was ordered.  
ALF WASHES HIMSELF IN IT.  
In Leo's boat were Butterface, Oolichuk, and Oblooria.  
You're a sharp boy for your age.  
P'r'aps we'd better  
change the subject.  
You'd better change Benjy for  
Oblooria.  
Anders howled,  
and dropped his reel.  
he groaned, rising to his feet.  
"And I support it," said Alf.  
It was an  
anxious moment.  
Ay, so there is something there.  
God grant that they may see it."  
"A whale, I think," said Leo.  
said Benjy;--"pass the biscuits."  
"Well, it seems as if we had."  
"Nothing wrong I hope, uncle?"  
no, lad, there's nothing wrong.  
"Not far," was the brief reply.  
He  
gave vent to a low growl.  
"They must be at war," he said.  
"With the Neerdoowulls," replied Chingatok with a frown.  
"And what is the Nort Pole, my son?"  
I've sometimes  
thought so myself.  
"Yes, that is what I come for.  
"Hold your tongue, Ben," whispered Alf.  
"Shall we submit to insult?  
I want to know what _He_ says.'  
A roar of laughter burst forth.  
"The Kablunets say he was--from so big."  
"Is he black under the clothes?"  
At this his men laughed outright.  
We'll give it 'em bit by bit."  
"You gib it 'im a'most too  
strong, Massa Benjee."  
"No," said the old man, "never."  
D'ye see that goose over there?"  
"Ay, Benjy, I want that goose.  
Keep her full, and mind  
your helm."  
Don't you trace it quite plainly?"  
A squall like this can't last long.  
Then dey kill you, an' me, an' Oblooria."  
Leo laid down his weapon.  
asked Leo in a low tone.  
We only want to see it.  
It was very perplexing.  
returned Leo, quietly.  
We must keep up our name.  
"And is not Puiroe my property?"  
no never, never, _never_!"  
"And he, too, had a father."  
"More like a sneeze than a squall.  
Listen; that is a queer pattering  
sound."  
How I wish uncle were here!"  
Leo did not slumber long.  
It was  
still a profound calm.  
He send me to say you muss come."  
They dashed aside right and  
left.  
Now, Oblooria, hold on tight for your life!"  
They were  
close to the victim.  
"Yes, yes," replied Alf quickly.  
"No; I say it to my shame, Chingatok.  
"Yes--our enemies," said Amalatok.  
"Well, uncle, what's the news?"  
You're looking  
_all round it_, lad.  
There is danger in the air.  
"Confusion worse confounded!"  
For three days the storm lasted.  
We have no such fell design.  
They were too busy for that.  
But Butterface's strong point was the flute!  
"I am not so sure of _that_!"  
"My brother chief is wise," said Grabantak.  
"I've got it at last, father!  
The characters  
are queer, too.  
I begin this diary to-day.  
He was only a  
seaman.  
"What is it to be, father?"  
His efforts were successful.  
But then, how was it to end?  
"Don't you wish you may get me?"

Talkin' 'bout going abroad."  
"Don't want to, Mas'r Harry," he said.  
"South America, Mas'r Harry!"  
"Don't you believe my word, Tom?"  
"Really in earnest, Mas'r Harry?  
"Yes, my lad, it will indeed."  
"Now then, what Tom-fool's game's this?"  
said my mother; "don't say that."  
"Come, come, old lady, courage!  
"No, it hasn't, Mas'r Harry," he groaned.  
"A tremendous deal more, Tom.  
"Where's the water to run?"  
Why, I never thought of that."  
have they measured it, Mas'r Harry?"  
I should think I do," cried Tom.  
"What sort o' fish are there, then?"  
"Well, let's hope not," I said.  
"That's very true," I said.  
"That was a fine un," said Tom.  
"And what do you think it was?"  
said Tom contemptuously.  
"How far was it from the shore?"  
I can't abide eels even.  
"I don't know, Tom," I replied.  
People have died from their bite."  
"No, he does not grow tea, Tom."  
the sun does go it out here."  
"Yes, Tom; this is the tropics."  
Only think of it, Mas'r Harry!  
"What's this place called, Mas'r Harry?"  
"No, Tom, it's an earthquake!"  
"The window--the window, Tom!"  
"This is no time for fooling!  
"Ain't I looking for my legs?  
Yes, they are common things here."  
but you shall starve for this, Juan!"  
"I'm very well content."  
I say, don't, Mas'r Harry," whined Tom, "don't!  
exclaimed Tom with a shudder.  
Why, the river swarms with them!"  
We shall be eat up alive!  
I exclaimed excitedly.  
"Why, it was a cry for help.  
There, Mas'r Harry, look at that chap!"  
lay into it, my hearty!"  
Is it much farther, Mas'r Harry?"  
Look at the colour of 'em!  
ALL IS NOT GOLD THAT GLITTERS.  
What have you got in your eye?"  
"I couldn't, Uncle," I exclaimed.  
We had just finished the mid-day meal.  
"She will laugh at me," I thought.  
I ejaculated, and then I was speechless.  
"Was what a very big one?"  
What I say is--Let's try."  
"You think it will be here still?"  
don't speak above a whisper.  
"Only in the low river-side parts, Tom.  
"What do you think of this, Tom?"  
"No, I say, pray don't, Mas'r Harry!"  
If I could find it again.  
How far from the light of day?  
Just lend a hand here, Mas'r Harry."  
But I ain't a bit afraid."  
But--but, Mas'r Harry, what's that?"  
But pray get a light, Mas'r Harry!"  
From where, from what strange regions?  
"Now look here, Mas'r Harry," he said.  
said Tom, whose teeth chattered as he spoke.  
"But are they real birds, Mas'r Harry?"  
I exclaimed excitedly.  
Yes, and there goes another!"  
"Never mind, Mas'r Harry," said Tom.  
"You'll have to go and leave me.  
I can hold on no longer."  
Had Tom said, "Shall we keep on?"  
we are going back, my lad!"  
"Mas'r Harry," he exclaimed, "don't be down-hearted.  
Never mind, let's turn back.  
"Right this time, Mas'r Harry," cried Tom.  
Can't you hear their wings whistle?  
There's a hole of some kind.  
But nothing rewarded my endeavours.  
Always the same tradition!  
"Want me to do _what_, Mas'r Harry?"  
"Just so, Harry; but take care."  
"No," I exclaimed, "let me, Tom!"  
They're on the look-out for us you see.  
P'r'aps they will yet, so I wouldn't move."  
How so be: just as you like.  
I'm ready when you are."  
what's that you've got, Mas'r Harry?"  
I whispered excitedly.  
step back and leave the treasure?  
Who would be slain I wondered.  
Now, what's to be done next?"  
"Will you take first turn, Mas'r Harry?"  
"And, Tom, I want your advice.  
"Don't show fight unless they do."  
You beggar and vagabond!  
"Pure metal, I think, senor?"  
"Now, then, where are you shovin' to, eh?"  
"And you found all that, Harry!  
"That is not a hundredth part.  
I said interrupting him.  
"Disputed if it were known.  
said my uncle anxiously.  
"Coming from the place, Uncle?  
'Tain't good for the constitution."  
"But pursuit, Uncle," I cried.  
You must look out, lads--look out."  
You are to be one of the privy-councillors."  
"He left us to come indoors.  
Why, he had not half-a-dozen yards to go."  
"No, no," said the notary.  
said my aunt uneasily.  
I thought he might have returned."  
"Look here, Mas'r Harry," he exclaimed.  
"Gently there, Mas'r Harry," said Tom.  
"So I thought, Tom," I exclaimed.  
MY UNCLE'S ADVENTURE.  
There's thousands of 'em here."  
But now see about this place.  
"But about canoes, uncle?"  
"What was that Garcia said?"  
I then whispered to Lilla.  
"Am I to shoot or ain't I?  
"Right, Mas'r Landell," said Tom coolly.  
whispered a voice at my side.  
But there was no occasion.  
"No," I said, arresting him.  
"But who is that--Garcia?  
"Never mind," gasped my uncle.  
"But what muscles you boys have!"  
"Uncle, we must have a light."  
You are our prisoner!"  
said my uncle anxiously.  
I'll work away," he replied.  
"Leave the gold behind, Mas'r Harry!"  
he cried; "not if I know it."  
Those were terrible moments!  
"Loose your hold or I fire!"  
And what has it all come to?"  
I should have been better off."  
I'm as live as ever.  
"The richest of the rich, Tom."  
"Yes, Mas'r Harry--the bones, you know.  
OUR TROUBLESOME BURDEN.  
Wal, they'll weigh up pretty smart.  
"Yes, I found him right enough."  
Guess I don't want to quarrel."  
"I'll take you, only I sail to-night."  
I haven't got no one to see."  
Are you come to pay me out?"  
whispered Tom excitedly.  
"I'll run down at once," I cried.  
I said; "I've had no letter."  
My mother looked up at me wonderingly.  
"but he was in trouble too."  
Had he no friend to help him?"

And how is your uncle now?"  
"Certainly not, Tom," I said.

But I am sorry for Ma.

Your Pa isn't jealous, is he?"

"An' what could _you_ do with land?"  
"That's right, old 'ooman, out with it."  
"I know'd ye'd agree to it.  
"Come, Otto; don't talk nonsense.

Otto had found a dead tree.  
They required no urging.  
"Come, John, you ain't agoin' to do it.  
That's also fair, isn't it?  
"Impossible," said Otto.

"But what about the schoolhouse?"

Proverbially a stern chase is a long one.

"Sure it isn't me as is judge.  
"Now, boys--ready with

"An' wan more for the doctor!"  
Dominick rose and went out.

But it seems very sudden.  
Of course it was Francisco!  
"But how was it, Francisco?"  
"We shall see," Matteo laughed.  
"Well, Giuseppi, what do you think of this?"  
How long have you been on board?"  
He could not deny the fact.  
Francis accompanied him.  
No, no, Messer Francisco.  
They are robbers, the Genoese.  
"So she has," the captain said.  
"And have you heard anything?"  
Then the captain gave the word.  
Giulia shook her head decidedly.  
"What do you say, Francisco?"  
"I don't know," Matteo said.  
"It is too late to escape.  
"What shall we do, Francisco?"  
"That is nonsense, Francisco.  
Francis said impatiently.  
"Now, Matteo, for a climb.  
The Genoese did not look round.  
"What fooling are you up to?"  
We tricked them famously, sir.  
It is not so in Venice.  
The notice was a short one.  
But I know my countrymen.  
"Against a Genoese galley!"  
Has he lost the remainder?"  
Fieschi sailed boldly out to meet him.  
"It was in the battle, sir.  
"Your daughters are well, I hope?"  
"There is no mistaking her.  
"Very deep," Francis agreed.  
"All hands will help at the oars."  
"We have done all that we could.  
We have no cargo on board."  
"He will do his best, I know.  
The Genoese are not like us.  
"Listen, they are quarrelling up on deck!"  
"It is getting dark in here."  
"I can't think how it fell out."  
"Why don't you keep your mouth shut, Philippo?"  
I have had enough of this.  
"Yes, the crew are all on board.  
"I do not want to kill you, Philippo.  
Then I will let you get up."  
He then allowed him to rise.  
Francis at once cut the bonds.  
"I do not think that he will.  
Francis walked down to the shore.  
start at once with the signor."  
"It is Francisco Hammond.  
"Lead me to them instantly."  
"Here, Maria, take my hand.  
"Francisco, do you see to Giulia.  
"Now come along, Francisco.  
"Then get out your oars again.  
There was a din of voices.  
The two engaged with fury.  
Polani was still strong and vigorous.  
How about your vengeance now?"  
I shall miss him terribly.  
The result was decisive.  
"I am not," Francis replied.  
"Very well, then," Francis said.  
The work was at once begun.  
"Try the others," Francis said.  
We shall want at least three more.  
"It is my voice, Rinaldo.  
"That will depend, Matteo.  
I will take the one to port.  
Use the vessels as you like.  
"You do not think so, young man?"  
There will be no further change.  
"What do you mean, Francisco?  
"That is right," Maria said.  
So, now, it is really true!  
"And to yourself," Rufino said laughing.  
"None at all," Francis replied.  
"I hear them," Matteo said.  
It lasted but a short time.  
Have you waited, Francisco?  
"Thinking over your dangers!  
Now go in and change your things.  
Well, what have you discovered?"  
I will not ask you more, now.  
"Did he inquire after me?  
"That, of course," Maria said.  
Nevertheless, they worked on unflinchingly.  
Men spoke no more of Zeno.  
He had been away for months.  
They talked rather of their homes.  
The next day they would return.  
"Let some light boats go off to reconnoitre.  
"Go off again, Francisco.  
If not, run up a blue flag!"  
I have no longer a doubt.

Well, and how goes it with you, Graheme?"  
That is what has brought us here.  
"You have the first appointments.  
He received them cordially.  
None have money wherewith to buy goods.  
The reports were not hopeful.  
Colonel Lindsay was shot dead.  
"Can you shelter me awhile?"  
Many were bleeding from wounds.  
Then the Scottish pikemen rushed forward.  
shouted Munro; "advance pikes!"  
They reined up when they reached him.  
The man replaced his pistol.  
"What shall we do with this boy?  
"So be it," the leader said.  
That we will fight is settled.  
"I blame you not," Malcolm said.  
"Is it you, Malcolm Graheme, or your wraith?"  
Do you know aught about him?"  
The pikemen at once fell upon them.  
Malcolm was one of the last.  
"Do you not remember me?"  
Why, what has happened to you?"  
"Thanks, indeed," Malcolm replied.  
Malcolm asked after a pause.  
A loud cheer broke from the walls.  
"This is my daughter Thekla."  
"Have you recently joined, sir?"  
The meal was a cheerful one.  
"Let us descend," the count said.  
"That will not do," the count said.  
You have chosen to resist.  
"The town is won now," he said.  
"Not at present," Nigel said.  
Is there any news, colonel?"  
he asked, turning to Munro.  
"Shall I take my weapons, sir?"  
It was a hand to hand fight.  
Can you come with me at once?  
"Yes, countess," Malcolm replied.  
"For swimming across the Rhine!"  
This was nearly full of hay.  
With his drawn sword he entered.  
"Crawl to the nearest cottage!"  
However, we shall soon see.  
"That is what I expected.  
This is a danger indeed."  
A laugh ran round the circle.  
All night the troops laboured at this task.  
Who won the day, I wonder?  
How bitterly cold it is!  
They turned him gently over.  
"Is the case hopeless, doctor?"  
Now let me look at his arm.  
I will tell you if you like."  
The count was the first to speak.  
My plan is a simple one.  
"Have not I alone saved him?  
Malcolm was also present.  
But they will not suspect me.  
Then they entered the stables.  
The rest is in your own hands.  
Others were cleaning their arms.  
Wallenstein has been foully murdered.

Jolly good joke of the gov.  
There never was such a chap!  
There will be when I come back!  
I am longing to get home.  
(He is _so_ good and handsome!)"  
"_Private and Confidential_.  
The fact is, I am engaged.  
"I am, yours truly,--  "Arthur.  
Railsford answered it honestly, if hesitatingly.  
Here a governor chuckled.  
Hymen comes to the rescue.  
"Your temper is good, is it?  
"Well, Mr Railsford, you may retire.  
Railsford laughed him pleasantly to scorn.  
A small child of eight appeared.  
"Is there anyone about?"  
You oughter be ashamed of yerself, young man.  
"I think we were up to time.  
"See that Mr Railsford gets dinner.  
Once more luck was against him.  
So much for your house duties.  
"Stick to it, Dig," cried others.  
"That's Ponsford all over," said he.  
How do you like your quarters?"  
"All serene," said the former.  
"How dare you disobey me?"  
"What, have you had a row, then?  
"All serene, Mr Railsford, old man!  
"On the other side of me.  
He has the house next to mine.  
"What, didn't I tell you, Dimsdale?  
Tell Dimsdale about--you know."  
"Pussy cat," suggested one.  
"Was that you, Oakshott, making that row?"  
"Oh, he's not tipped you, then?  
"Are you going, you fellows?"  
I think we'd better not go."  
"That's against rules, isn't it?"  
"Have you noticed anything, Barnworth?"  
Felgate now came in with his remark.  
Of course, they'll say they've got leave."  
Will you see, Ainger, as you go up?"  
Meanwhile he would go to sleep.  
I don't like the animal.  
He's too fussy for me."  
"Of course I'm not, you ass.  
Besides, we've not started yet.  
Still, he bore him no malice.  
It was a complete success.  
"Whatever _is_ the matter?"  
"This time I will let that do."  
broke in Arthur; "you're a brick!  
They had already done so.  
"And--he calls her `_Chuckey_,' I heard him.  
asked Smedley, as they parted.  
"There's nobody about.  
"Herapath, come here, and hold out your hand."  
I believe the masters meet to-night.  
"I'll take my chance of that," said Railsford.  
"The bo--od--y," whispered Simson.  
"Whatever does all this mean?"  
There is one other matter.  
This was just like the doctor.  
"Reply to the question, sir!"  
"I wonder what it all means?"  
Smedley therefore went straight to Railsford.  
"May I go and see Ainger, please, sir?"  
"It couldn't be anyone else.  
But Railsford had nothing to suggest.  
said Smedley, rather alarmed.  
Still he must go through with it.  
It's no business of yours."  
Do you know who it was, then?  
What's this precious letter?"  
The result was decisive.  
what a clever chap I am!  
"Yes--they were no good at all."  
"I don't know; I suppose so."  
"Your name is William Tomkins?"  
"That's what I mean to do.  
Come, Mr What's-your-name, what should you think?"  
Bowled the chap out clean, first ball.  
"I never thought it of him.  
"I fancy so," said Arthur.  
"No--better keep it all dark.  
That's all I want to say.  
suggested the baronet.  
Bateson had been smoking.  
Railsford took the cigar and sniffed it.  
I should die if you made me.  
"I don't understand you, sir."  
Is there nothing wrong in that?"  
"You may smoke them yourself, sir."  
Felgate had a wonderful gift of self-delusion.  
He admits he smokes himself.  
It was by no means ended.  
Where did you pick it all up?"  
"It was a notion I had."  
But what about the high jump?"  
"I may as well scratch at once.  
Mind he doesn't do it for you."  
Unless you do, we lose it."  
"No you won't; enter Stafford.  
Hadn't he done them harm enough?  
"_I_ don't think it dull, thank you."  
You ought to be in your house."  
Be careful about fouling.  
Now, boys, are you all ready?  
"I'll read it when I have time."  
Thanks awfully for the bob."  
No end of a crow for us.  
Violet nodded to me!  
Smedley turned up too; brickish, wasn't it?  
After that it was all right.  
`Splendid, old fellow,' said he.  
He and Marky don't hit it.  
He had some cause to be pleased.  
"Good-evening," said he, with a friendly smile.  
"Oh, yes; I remember now.  
"I understood perfectly.  
"It's amusing, isn't it?"  
It's too absurd, really!"  
He's gone to Wake's room."  
I heard you'd been out of sorts.  
Was it the sports knocked you up?"  
I'll wait here till you come back."  
"I'm safe, never you fear."  
Don't let it occur again.  
Is he so very ill, then?"  
There may be a letter there."  
"I'm not afraid," said he.  
The murder was out, but how?  
"Has he taken anything?"  
Have you found out where he lives?"  
He long remembered that night.  
Come along--sharp--coast's clear!"  
"They will be here by the four-o'clock train.  
"Hullo, young 'un," said he, "another dog?  
"Oh, he was seedy--sore throat.  
We thought as Felgate said--oh, you cad!"  
"No more am I," said Simson.  
Felgate doesn't go; why don't you make him?"  
The captain put down his bat.  
Don't think it will put us out."  
I've told you what I shall do."  
I'm not going to fight."  
I oughtn't to have let it out.  
"Not good enough," said Arthur.  
"He's a prefect," said he.  
"A first eleven chap," ejaculated Dig.  
thirteen, counting Tilbury.  
It'll be too late to do it to-morrow."  
I haven't gone in for it yet."  
Roaring Tommy was nowhere.  
Mills stared at the document.  
"Yes; a rank outsider, too.  
"It's a swindle, Mr Railsford.  
"Why, that blackleg swindler in there!"  
"You must go to him to-morrow evening."  
"Oh, Mr Railsford, he'll expel me!"  
"Possibly," said the master.  
He knew he would get his rights!  
"And where is the list of names?"  
THE NATURALISTS' FIELD CLUB.  
Besides, it wasn't for money."  
Railsford looked at him curiously.  
Arthur was in ecstasy.  
Which of course he did promise.  
Not in that concern, are you?  
Rather rough riding, wasn't it?"  
I'll be home as soon as you."  
He told me to tell you so.  
We've been scrambling about.  
Can I come in the tandem?"  
"Going after owls," said Dig.  
Railsford was not a bit less concerned.  
He cannot hear us down here."  
"Pretty cold and stiff, old man.  
How jolly of you to come!  
How are we going down now?"  
"Have you seen the doctor yet?"  
Railsford laughed a short uneasy laugh.  
"Yes, yes--go on," urged Stafford.  
"Wouldn't they grin if we turned up?"  
said Arthur; "I vote we do."  
He looked into their study.  
"They're still on the sick list," said Ainger.  
Arthur nodded knowingly.  
"I'm game," said Dig; "but how?"  
"Get the things back, anyhow.  
"Yes--two to one he'll be there.  
Please do not mention my name.  
Don't let anyone see you."  
Don't believe a word I say.  
Most of them know already.  
"Looks like it," replied Arthur.  
Even if he did, Felgate didn't care.  
They've done us no good so far."  
"Your chimney's on fire!"  
I have my thoughts often, friend Railsford.  
The master was not challenged.  
Don't believe a word I say.  
"Order, please," said the chairman.  
I defy him to do it!  
Felgate looked at him in amazement.  
However had it got there?  
Say what you want there, can't you?"  
We'll all go home together."  
Why ever are you going?  
"No, old fellow, I fear not.  
exclaimed Arthur, in disgust.  
There were three of us in it.  
CLEARING UP, AND CLEARING OUT.  
But how were they to do it?  
"Munger _has_ kept quiet," said Barnworth.  
Staff, do you mind bringing him?"  
"You know well enough, Munger."  
What is it you want to ask?"  
"Very well, you can go now.  
"And whose do you belong to?"  
"And which is Mr Bickers?"  
"How did you discover that?"  
"Certainly," said the doctor.  
They grudged the school the other half.  
Dig's here; we've got a cab.  
or, "No good, Maple, my boy, bespoke!"  
She liked everything she saw.  
"Three cheers for Miss Violet!"  
"Three cheers for the governors!"

"Come away, Geo'ge--an' you too, Eddard La--La-whatever-it-is!"  
"Do you forgive me, Hester?"  
And it _was_ an awful place!  
Thus far the middy read the letter.  
I's not bin used to it.  
Peter, what are you doing?  
"No, sar, you's not in haste.

AN ENCOUNTER IN THE WOOD.  
Hundreds, where he could dive down.  
he grunted; "might have been worse.  
Now then: once more, to begin."  
he muttered, the next moment.  
"Brute, savage, and now coward!  
"Got rid of you," he muttered.  
"There, it's no good," he cried.  
Waller felt a little touched.  
Are you a bit off your head?  
Who wants to hang or shoot you?  
"I am as weak as a child."  
The lad bowed his head slightly.  
"I will not try to escape.  
"Oh," said Waller thoughtfully.  
"But you have not come from there?"  
"Oh, I don't know," said Waller.  
cried Waller indignantly.  
The words came with a sob, "Go!  
He tried to rise, but sank back.  
"I have picked some leaves," he said.  
"No; I am an enemy.  
"Let them do their work themselves.  
Take a good drink of this first."  
"Oh, no; go on," said Waller.  
"We are good enough friends now.  
She does hate to see him here."  
"Oh, I don't know," said the girl pettishly.  
"There, now, if that isn't funny!"  
said the girl, clapping her hands.  
"Nothing," said Waller gruffly.  
"But she meant it for your tea."  
"Then it's all true," he mused.  
Don't keep it all to yourself.  
What did he say his name was?  
But what about Joe Hanson?  
"I have come back," said Waller.  
"Yes," he said, "I am ready.  
"Am I speaking properly?  
he continued, more gently.  
"Well, you had better lie down.  
"Oh, I don't know--horrid things!  
"Pours all the sand out again."  
"Then why did you say he had?"  
"I didn't mean spy," said Waller.  
I can think of nothing else."  
The old one was quite worn out.  
"Yes," said the lad wearily.  
There, good-bye for the present."  
"What's the matter, Martha?"  
"She's had a fright, my dear.  
cried Waller excitedly.  
I only heard it walking.  
"It's all stuff, and nonsense.  
No such thing could have happened.  
said Waller tentatively.  
Made a big lump on my head."  
But, of course, I would come back.  
"What do I want with a rope?"  
It was all excitement now.  
No-- gently swing to and fro.  
What game have you been up to?"  
"Is anything the matter?  
You may just as well confess.  
"No, of course not," said Godfrey sulkily.  
I meant to come up again."  
"Don't be hard on me, Waller.  
You don't know what I suffered.  
You must have been half-mad, old fellow."  
"I have been up two hours."  
No; I was not quite awake.  
There it is, all soaked with dew.  
They'll be all right now, I think."  
"I like to hear you talk so.  
"What business is it of theirs?  
"Coming to hunt for spies, sir."  
"What are you going to do?"  
"What do you mean by that, sir?"  
"Yes, sir, in the King's name."  
Don't he speak up like a man!"  
You have been in the dining-room, I see."  
"What do you know about it?"  
Yes, sir, I have looked through the dining-room.  
Excuse me for saying so.  
"What about the cellar, sir?"  
"Where does that staircase lead, sir?"  
"There's one of these 'ere doors locked!"  
My lads are neither sweeps nor tilers.  
"Thank you, sir," said the sergeant grumpily.  
You are not our sergeant."  
I want to get this job done.  
"To be sure," said the sergeant.  
"That's right enough, sergeant.  
"Hold hard a minute, soldier!"  
Just look here, Master Waller!  
I think there's something broke!"  
"No, of course not," said Waller.  
They don't know you like I do.  
Pray help me to-night to get away."  
"Is the enemy quite gone?"  
I'll lock you in and go down.  
"Where did you get that turnip?"  
There's a shilling for you.  
Now then, what about them halves?"  
"You came to look in and spy?"  
What if he is put away?  
"That I didn't, Master Waller.  
He ar'n't so stupid as he looks.  
A lot of the fox in him.  
"How have I fibbed or lied to you?  
Don't be waxy with me, lad."  
I did think you were a man!"  
"What, could you hide him somewhere?"  
cried Waller excitedly.  
"What about the winter time?"  
"Oh, but it wouldn't be for long."  
"Why, I'd--I'd--I'd--half smash him!  
You might trust him anywhere.  
That's so; and look here, sir.  
"May you depend on me, lad?  
"What are you thinking about?"  
cried Waller excitedly.  
said Godfrey excitedly.  
"Isn't it dangerous for him?"  
Bunny can climb like a cat.  
The soldiers is coming here to-night."  
"That's right, sir," said Bunny.  
Don't be afraid of it, sir.  
"I'm all right," said Bunny.  
Bunny was at the bottom.  
"And I never said good-bye!"

Primrose was delightfully matter-of-fact.  
THE FIRST MONTH OF THEIR TROUBLE.  
There are mothers and mothers.  
She died and her children were broken-hearted.  
"Oh, Miss Primrose--," she began.  
"Oh yes, miss," answered Hannah.  
I could not have believed it.  
how were they to meet the world?  
and your collar, is it neat?  
Shall I set some slips for you?  
Is she not fascinating?  
"Joseph, how stupid you are!  
"Joseph, you are a genius.  
where's the Persian kitten?"  
"Smell them; aren't they delicious?  
asked the lady of the house.  
She promised, and kept her word.  
"My bonny boy was stolen.  
Jasmine was standing without.  
WAYS OF EARNING A LIVING.  
"Now, deary, whatever for?"  
Come into the garden now, Eyebright.  
Primrose raised her head slowly.  
"My love, I am delighted.  
"Not at all," answered Primrose.  
This is inevitable.  
I am not what you think me.  
Certainly not kind Mrs. Ellsworthy.  
"Oh, Primrose, how sad you look!"  
Tell her our plan quickly.  
IN SPITE OF OPPOSITION.  
she said, rising to her feet.  
She would give you comforts--oh!  
"Daisy darling, hold my hand.  
"Tired, pretty little dear!"  
Ah, I know all about it."  
I had a queer dream last night.  
Here Mrs. Flint frowned at her.  
It is another biting.  
All right, Miss Slowcum, I'll keep behind.  
"This is your first visit here?"  
"Lor, miss, you do startle me.  
Can you come with us to-morrow, Poppy?"  
What is it we're all a-going to do to-morrow?"  
No, no; none of it for me.  
"I don't know," answered Jasmine.  
You said you liked to do it.  
questioned Primrose, thoughtfully.  
Why can't we have some more coal?  
"Oh, I don't know; they suit me.  
You won't be selfish, will you, Eyebright?  
"I won't be selfish, Jasmine.  
Just kiss me before you go."  
I don't wish it to be known.  
Now, good-bye, miss--eat up your sweeties."  
"Oh, Eyebright, what a silly question!  
what a funny child you are!  
I have been watching for you.  
I am so glad you have come.  
A STARTLING DISCOVERY.  
She felt completely puzzled.  
How relieved my dear mother-friend will be!"  
"No, my dear boy, I cannot.  
[Illustration: DOVE MET THEM.  
Why does he make my heart beat?  
"Your true little friend,      DAISY."  
"The three young ladies, of course."  
A "CONTINUAL READER."  
Poppy, why it ain't nowhere!  
Oh, my darling young lady!  
"It sounds lovely," said Daisy.  
she inquired anxiously.  
VISITING THE PUBLISHERS.  
"Are you quite ready, Poppy?  
"I had no choice," said Noel.  
THEIR QUARTER'S ALLOWANCE.  
What can the picture be?--oh!  
"What is the matter, Daisy?"  
"Yours faithfully,      "JOHN DAVIS."  
"Do you want it, Miss Jasmine?"  
he asked, looking at Jasmine.  
"Will you open it, Primrose?  
"Your loving little      "DAISY."  
A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT.  
MRS. DREDGE TO THE RESCUE.  
"It took me all of a heap!"  
Did she not share my secret?  
It is most mysterious.  
Oh, you must let me read this."  
"My name is Arthur Noel."  
"Sir, be pleased to take a seat.  
"What do you mean by that, sir?"  
Hannah heaved a profound sigh.  
"You have come at last, Mr.  
DELIVERED FROM THE OGRE.  
What shall I do about it?"  
"Is anything the matter?"  
I wish I could go with you.  
"What is the matter with her?"  
Well, she must have it all back to-day.  
So you must be going, miss?  
ONE SHOE OFF AND ONE SHOE ON.  
"Oh, not at all, Biddy, dear.  
I must see to it at once.  
But Miss Egerton was gone.  
What has she taken to pawn?  
"Yes, ten pounds is quite enough.  
She opened it eagerly.  
Jasmine smiled, and flushed brightly.  
"A little," answered Jasmine.  
Oh, you are a real, real friend!"  
You must love us very much."  
Jasmine smiled, and her cheeks flushed.  
I don't want to think of it.  
"Why, you are all trembling.  
"What kind of person, Henry?"  
"You'll excuse me, ma'am," she said.  
"Better for herself, is she?"  
"I've seen it for a long time.  
"It seems better than a dream.

I wonder why this is  
so."  
All was at once commotion.  
"Little Tim will go with me?"  
It's useless," he exclaimed.  
There seemed to be very few.  
Let my friend help me to mount."  
"My brother's voice is strong.  
The combatants  
heard and paused.  
They were thus taken in  
rear.  
He strode  
swiftly through the camp.  
"Is that _her_--_the_ girl, you know?"  
I have not  
strength to ride far.  
Manitou thinks it time for me to die.  
THE MASSACRE AND THE CHASE.  
demanded  
Whitewing somewhat sharply.  
asked the Indian quickly.  
But His ways are very dark.  
Her brother sternly refused.  
"Now,  
Whitewing, it behoves us to be cautious.  
Yet I make no  
doubt yer right.  
"Sister," she said, "Manitou has sent help.  
He was much too tough for that.  
He did not even  
complain!  
But Tim was prepared  
for that.  
The  
sentinel stood transfixed.  
"Has the pale-face preacher com' vis him?"  
Now, you'll be careful, soft one?"  
"Your husband--what is his name!"  
"You be  
deaded soon if you not com queek."  
On the fourth side was the hut.  
To which his men returned, "How!"  
But of what use would it  
be?  
She will not hamper Big Tim.  
"Yes; Softswan has explained it to me.  
"Is the preacher badly hurt?"  
"So say I," returned Big Tim.  
"You wants to catch one alive?"  
"Well, what will you _try_ it for?"  
goin' out alone, Little Tim?"  
A safe stand-by at all times.  
Pity we hasn't all got it!"  
The hunter  
wasted no time.  
"Good mornin' to 'ee," he said, looking down.  
Now, hold on--just one moment.  
Bounding Bull pondered the words.  
"Yes, dear fasser, mosser's at home."  
You're goin' to meet an old  
friend."  
Is not my father here, and Whitewing?  
A slight nod was  
the reply.  
"Does the fawn mate with the wolf?"  
THE PURSUIT, FAILURE, DESPAIR.  
"No; we left her in the camp."  
"A messenger from the camp!"  
Big Tim was close on his  
heels.  
Yes, you  
are a lucky girl."  
asked Umqua,  
after a brief silence.  
"Eaglenose," replied the skipper promptly.  
the other, "He doeth all things well."  
What does he rest  
his hope on?"  
"The little husband did well.  
Does the skipping one know Leetil Tim?"  
"Eaglenose knows not fear," returned the youth boastfully.  
The touch was painful, so he desisted.  
Not so the captive Moonlight.  
He has been hit in his heart."  
Rushing River said no more.  
Brighteyes hears voices in the night air."  
"Not in the camp, my daughter.  
Umqua has no  
choice but to obey."  
It was very perplexing!  
"Yes, father, it's all true.

All this outside the mountain!  
It grew darker and darker.  
He knocked, but heard no answer.  
He dared not hesitate, though.  
'But there's no moon outside,' said Curdie.  
'There are more moons than you know of, Curdie.  
'What wrong were you doing all day, Curdie?  
'I see now what you really are!'  
'Please, ma'am--what am I to call you?'  
Yes, Mother, I'll do it,' said Curdie.  
Some said their wives had seen her.  
'Because you're not saying anything.'  
'I see you know me, Curdie,' said a voice.  
'Yes, you have seen it, Curdie,' said the voice.  
Do not be afraid, but watch.'  
CHAPTER 7  What Is in a Name?  
They only knew that it shone.  
I'm not so young as you.'  
'Nor so old as the princess,' said Curdie.  
Don't you know this is my house?'  
I am one of his household.  
'I dare not say anything, ma'am.  
But he did not draw them back.  
'Did I make a noise and vex you?'  
'I must mind what I am about.'  
'Even when it's with his own will?'  
It showed a skin white and smooth.  
Curdie took it, trembling with joy.  
But love makes all safe--doesn't it, Curdie?'  
'No, no, my boy,' answered Peter.  
And while Curdie ate there came a change.  
said Curdie, 'you got all those helping me.'  
For seven days it lasted.  
'Why, you booby of a miner!  
'Look at your friend's forehead,' said Curdie.  
'Give me that stone,' said the barber.  
'I thought you wanted the stone,' said Curdie.  
Curdie stooped and picked up another.  
'Give me that stone,' said the barber.  
You pay me for that window.'  
'Stranger,' said the first, 'that bulldog is mine.'  
'I'll kill one--you kill the other.'  
'We're not the least afraid of you.'  
A push then opened the door.  
'Speak to him, Lina,' he whispered.  
'I am here, and they shan't touch you.  
I am watching it for you.'  
'What sort of man is your doctor?'  
You will like him very much.'  
returned Irene, in wonder.  
'I hope you have not hurt yourself?'  
The doctor approached the bed.  
I heard them say he was drunk!'  
'The cellar, Lina: go,' he said.  
Curdie came near, and softly called her.  
She reflected an instant.  
When her master said, 'Now, Lina!'  
'Pray, my lord, permit her to try.'  
'Your Majesty heard but a part.'  
'And I can hear no more today.'  
Wait here till I come again.'  
Curdie ran up, and held out his hand.  
'But what have you done with the crown, Curdie?'  
'You won't believe me,' said the girl.  
'A pretty piece of insolence!  
The steward took it up next.  
said the groom of the chambers.  
Tell me that, Miss Innocence.'  
I wonder who's unkind!  
No one came to light the lamp.  
They all came crowding about Curdie.  
'I will be with you very soon.'  
Will you go fooling it still?  
Haven't you had enough of it?'  
said the page, and stepped between.  
Threaten your masters, indeed!  
Actually confesses!  
She went straight at the butler.  
Their loftily reasonable city!  
'Why, that's never the emerald!'  
He could not tell what had waked him.  
Glorious terrible sight!  
She was large and strong as a Titaness.  
'What must we be doing today, Curdie?'  
Call the colonel of the guard.'  
You shall head your beasts today.  
'Seven times, my king,' said the colonel.  
'In the stable,' answered the maid.  
Curdie struck down the foremost with his mattock.  
Horses reared and plunged and wheeled.  
The citizens had fled home.  
Ye slaves, behold your leaders!  
Irene held out her arms to Curdie.

THE RED MAN'S REVENGE, BY R.M.  
"So you are, Tony, my boy!"  
They sallied forth to the  
work in hand.  
asked Victor, as he went out.  
"One more word before we part.  
They are a pigheaded generation.  
The trader  
was still in sight.  
That hen was frightfully plain.  
She was obviously tough.  
He'll come oot of it,  
whatever."  
"No, he won't," replied Angus.  
The Indian sprang on shore.  
"Tony's been carried off--Petawanaquat!  
Water began to pour in.  
The break was not a bad one.  
"Hand it here, Vic," said Ian.  
there _is_ a canoe in it.  
"Yes, oui, no--dat is to say.  
We're sure to succeed in the long-run.  
You vill engage me; I vill go vid you.  
what sort of a bird is that?"  
Victor had a dream that night.  
Could a civilised man have done much  
more?  
At last the Indian spoke.  
"Vich means dat youth bees impetoous toujours," said Rollin.  
"Even so, boys," said Ian.  
"Is Louis Lambert with you?"  
Victor held on by the mane.  
Victor stood in the stirrups.  
He was a splendid horseman.  
He seems to prefer tough meat."  
"I don't deny anything.  
"We are just coming to one.  
"It is clear zat you do not loike it."  
"How d'you know that I don't like it?"  
They made for the bush country.  
But then that was long ago.  
He smiled as he thought of her.  
"What a noisy goose you are!"  
It will be a straight end-on race now.  
There was but one course open.  
Still, they pushed on hopefully.  
It was fair when they lay down.  
asked Ian, without moving.  
inquired Rollin, chuckling.  
His companions followed suit.  
"Contrariness," said Victor.  
Con--convulsions, dat is it.  
Anyhow it vould injure his  
digestiveness."  
"I'll go with you," said Warder.  
"It's madness to stop here.  
Before daylight the moon rose.  
They rose with it  
and pushed on.  
much food yonder in the bush!  
they are eating eating now!  
It would have delayed  
themselves.  
The old man was a little careworn.  
exclaimed Lambert, starting up.  
asked Cora, in some surprise.  
Black Dick's in the stable.  
A stout young half-breed was the driver.  
The team was fresh and lively.  
Ian do  
love your sister.  
exclaimed Victor, in surprise.  
Huge chips flew  
circling round.  
The noise was not repeated.  
_Have_ I killed the--  
the--grizzly?"  
"Is Lambert's own house safe?"  
But where should he remove to?  
There will be plenty of time.  
"Thank 'ee, no; this is the last load.  
it's not true," said Lambert.  
You are heartily welcome.  
"Do you think it safe to stay?"  
"He's gane to the kirk for floor.  
"I'm sweer'd to break the wundy," said Liz.  
Then she went to Mrs Ravenshaw's  
room.  
A long-drawn sigh and a gentle "hush!"  
_He_ knows what to do, I don't.  
"Fetch the pepper now, Miss Trim.  
Don't disturb Mrs R, though.  
Starting back with  
a slight, "Oh!"  
It iss fery coot of you, oo ay.  
The old trader did not speak.  
The cry was not repeated.  
'Pears as if I vas stop short at zee vaist!"  
"Tonyquat is a boy who keeps his word?"  
I don't quite recognise it.  
Here am me, go to bed vidout my smok.  
said Ian, in a tone of commiseration.  
Again we venture to skip.  
"Vat shall ye do vidout bot or canoe?"  
"What made you take him away?"  
asked Victor, in some  
surprise.  
he asked, with a puzzled look.  
I do believe I see the  
smoking-box.  
But Rollin made no reply.  
"It sounds like pigs," said Ian.  
"Come, Ian, why don't you eat?  
"Has the wedding come off yet?"  
Now I tell you what I'll do.  
The  
doorway's wide enough."  
But thought again intervenes.  
She was as good as her word.  
Her actions were impulsive.  
There was one figure in it.  
"I seek for ma mere," said the half-breed.  
echoed Elsie, in surprise.  
What induced you to steal him?"  
He will understand his friend.  
I said little, but listened.  
Petawanaquat returned the grasp in silence.  
It was a glorious time!  
"Bless me, Ian, iss it jokin' ye are?"  
It's in earnest I am."  
"My brother," he said, "beholds the sun.  
There is but _one thing  
needful_.  
Is not Jesus the one thing?  
Petawanaquat wishes to live for  
ever.  
In good time he shall know all."

Perhaps the--the--"  

"Patriots!"  
"Pedro," returned the Spaniard.  
remarked Pedro in passing.  
But I scarce  
know what to do.  
"And how did you escape, Quash?  
What were you about to  
say?"  
"Fall to the rear, Quashy," said Pedro.  
We'll bind his hands and leave him.  
I've warned you once  
already."  
"Yes, Pedro mentioned his name.  
"That's a strange character.  
I's mean like a--a buff'lo bull.  
I no see him by dat time.  
"So I am, senhor," replied the guide.  
"Surely you are not a Scot?"  
said Lawrence, with a quick glance.  
"I know not, senhor," replied the host.  
"No, senhor, it was far to the west.  
He rose and went out quickly.  
"You are, perhaps; I know not.  
Nebber could take kindly to dat stuff.  
Der am some tings in flosuffy dat beats me.  
Of course every one laughed.  
You have heard of the Incas, senhor?"  
"Why _was_ she born a savage?"  
a princess of the Incas!  
"De way we's agwine, to be sure.  
echoed Lawrence, in surprise.  
Senhor Armstrong, will you come with me?"  
My mother I never knew.  
She died when I was a child.  
It was my  
first meeting with Mariquita!  
"I was long ill after that.  
Next moment these came in sight.  
It was a tantalising point to stop at!  
"Have they done any damage?"  
Ebery day, more or less, dey hab a few.  
An'  
dey've bin shook more dan ornar ob late.  
"Yes, very sultry indeed."  
Full well he knew what it meant.  
It was an  
enormous beam.  
Shoot again," he cried, fiercely.  
But you are wounded, Senhor Armstrong."  
"No time for explanations.  
You can do it, I doubt not."  
OUTWITTED BY A BANDIT.  
"There _is_ such necessity, senhor.  
said Lawrence, following him.  
"I mean what I says, massa,--purrits."  
An exclamation followed.  
The "stuppid idjit" was enlightened at last.  
Everything seemed to  
bear fruit.  
Yet no jaguar could be seen.  
"O massa!--he not dead, eh?"  
No, it is impossible!  
I'll be with you directly."  
"No use, massa," said Quashy; "nebber make him understan'.

"Das what dey make de soup ob," said Quashy.  
"Dun' know what's a ragoo, massa.  
"They won't give  
me much trouble.  
`You'll have to run  
the rapid.  
That was early this morning.  
But we won't give them the chance.  
Man must work, or play, or fight.  
"Have you not heard about it?"  
It was too complicated.  
They are not quite so bad now.  
"Even so," replied Pedro.  
Has you got dem hoops tied, massa?"  
There--are these  
the right sizes?"  
Now, you looks here, ladies an' gen'lemen.  
replied the negro, curtly.  
"Yes, friendly," replied Tiger.  
There was  
no "cup" in the game.  
"Here they come," whispered Pedro.  
But where got you this news from?  
"But what will your father say?"  
Manuela did not object.  
"Well, yes, as far as it goes.  
said the negro, quite relieved.  
I t'ink you'll be de better ob me."  
"Yes, Quash,--very beautiful."  
"But I have no wish to go.  
Lawrence looked up with a start.  
Do you make out what I mean?  
I very sorry we part.  
He felt cured now, completely.  
She is intensely earnest.  
No child could be  
more simple.  
"Yes, that's it--exactly."  
They met Pedro at the door.  
"You may perhaps meet friends there."  
"A descendant of the Hottentots, sir!"  
Well, then,  
let me think it out.  
It is most interesting!  
I  
delight to think of her.  
"Is it--can it be--a dream?"  
"Nuffin's wrong, massa, now you talk.  
"You's git her in de long  
run."  
thought Lawrence, on awaking next morning.  
said Lawrence, as they drew near.  
exclaimed Lawrence, bitterly.  
You will need all your manhood.  
"Who are you, and who bound you?"  
asked this chief, with a stern look.  
"There's truth in that, old man.  
"An' Sooz'n," said Quashy, with a deeper groan.  
he asked, pointing to  
Pedro.  
If I might advise--come on!"  
But Cruz refused their well-meant advice.  
"Indeed no, Colonel Marchbanks.  
said the gratified negro.  
"What's dat got to do wid it?"  
Over the flowering plains!  
Perhaps it was something else.  
"Where were you born, Pizarro?"  
"In the hut where you found me, senhor."  
"How old are you, Pizarro?"  
"Well, den--"  

"No, Sooz'n, it's _ill_ den."  
"Well, an' what says de kurnel to dat?"  
muttered Quashy between his clenched teeth.  
"But what  
happen arter dat, Sooz'n?"  
"Such dis-_gusting_ cruelty," continued Bill.  
"Then he ain't fit for _this_  
world!  
and why does he  
send for me?"  
"I can't tell you his name, miss.  
Look here, dis  
was de way ob it.  
I wouldn't hab bin suprised at dat at all.  
"Why, child, how could you know that?  
The presumptuous puppy!"  
Go on wid your leetle game, an' nebber mind me.  
"You's bery good, Miss--a'most as good as Sooz'n."  
Mariquita the younger is beside him.

No; it was no fault of yours.  
I suppose it was my own."  
They did not take our lives."  
"No, not one of us, master."  
I only said it warn't safe."  
He jumped at the idea.  
"Shall I wake up the Doctor?"  
exclaimed the Doctor sharply.  
Why did he not go and see?"  
exclaimed the Doctor sharply.  
"I'll try," said Bart earnestly.  
said the Doctor, hurriedly.  
"That's his length to an 'alf inch."  
"`What's the matter with you?'  
"Tell me what you have made out."  
"Yes; see it as plain as plain."  
"Nay, I shan't tell you, my lad.  
That's for you to find out."  
"We've lost ever so much time, Joses."  
"I don't care what they look like.  
"And they are looking this way.  
"SURROUNDED BY INDIANS."  
"What's that, sir; the distance?"  
"I'm not, sir," replied Bart.  
"They didn't come along the trail."  
"I can't make him out," replied Joses.  
"His is a strange tongue to me."  
"He is wounded in the arm.  
"That means scouting, does it not?"  
Help me as I dress this arm.  
"You can be of use, perhaps."  
He won't wince, nor say a word.  
It was the sight of that knife.  
What would you like me to do?"  
"What are you going to do?"  
There was no hesitation.  
"Splendid grazing land," he said, "well-watered.  
I suppose it does you good."  
"I'll tell you, lad," said Joses, chuckling.  
said the Doctor, suddenly.  
"What a place to build a house!"  
cried Maude, clinging to his arm.  
"Be careful," cried the Doctor.  
"But are you not hurt at all?"  
But how about the grizzly?"  
"Dead, sir, quite dead," replied Bart.  
"You mind your own business," growled Joses.  
You see he's a bit sore."  
"What, Old Arrow--in--the--arm!"  
He's gone to watch them Injuns, safe."  
Why, they don't want no catching.  
"But not our sort of sheep?"  
No mutton for dinner to-day, boys.  
But where is it to be found?  
"Not much," said the frontier man.  
"Four to five thousand feet," said Joses.  
"No, my lad, they didn't hurt him.  
I could do it directly."  
It won't touch him, Master Bart.  
That would make him scuffle back."  
"No, no, Master Bart; his head.  
BLACK BOY AMUSES HIMSELF.  
"The Beaver-with-Sharp-Teeth says, let us eat," he said.  
"One of our own party.  
Bart's heart seemed to stand still.  
"I thought you were, sir," said Bart.  
I tell you what, Master Bart."  
"I tell you what, Master Bart."  
"And did you overtake them?"  
"I don't think we're very safe."  
I have seen no silver yet."  
Discovery, do I say!  
UNTRUSTWORTHY SENTINELS.  
I wouldn't have thought it of them."  
That's what I'll do to them.  
"But it is Juan, is it not?"  
"Yes, horrible," assented the Doctor.  
"Enemy," he said sharply.  
But they had not been deceived.  
"Why don't the Beaver come back, Joses?"  
If we had, we shouldn't do it."  
Their horses will be useful.  
the man asked, staring at him wonderingly.  
Now, come and have a look round."  
"I don't call them scrubs of things trees.  
"This is silver, is it not?"  
That's what I call silver.  
"Why, what for--to get water?"  
PREPARATIONS FOR SAFETY.  
It will save so much trouble."  
said Joses, in a low, growling tone.  
You try and pull Black Boy in.  
"Then you would not surrender?"  
"May we ride up to them now?"  
"To be sure you are, my boy.  
"Well, how many bufflers did you shoot?"  
"He's a fine one, my lad.  
why, of course, they haven't gone far."  
Yes; I might have known as much.  
"I know 'em better than that."  
"I know what I'm saying.  
DOWN IN THE SILVER CANYON.  
"This light deceives me; it is silver."  
It was the work of moments.  
Let us get back to the camp."  
"Have you seen anything, then?"  
"Have you heard of anything?"  
There's no deceiving them."  
"Did the Doctor order this?"  
"But where are the Apaches?"  
IN THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.  
Now, Beaver, what do you say?"  
"I can't see nothing--can you?"  
"I can see nothing but trees."  
I know I should not have missed."  
It wants a sharp poke, my lad.  
"That woke him up, I suppose?"  
they're coming down the canyon.  
"Keep down, will you, Master Bart!  
I say, have you fired yet?"  
"Must I fire _at_ them then, Joses?"  
"Time to go," the Beaver said.  
Now then; back behind those rocks.  
Another run for it--quick!"  
You must each bring down your man."  
shouted Joses; "now for the chimney.  
Now, Beaver--now's your time!"  
"Yes," said the chief; "shoot much first."  
But there, we have no time for repining.  
Joses, can you be a true prophet?"  
"Speak English uses his eyes.  
"And so made only one trail!"  
They could not find our trail.  
I said medicine," chuckled Joses.  
"Well, what's the difference?"  
"Apache dogs," he whispered.  
Let me have a look, my lad."  
"I'm to come too, ain't I?"  
Would they hear them on the rocks?  
"I know, Joses," replied the Doctor.  
"They will never stay away."  
Nature will have her own way.  
"I will guide them to the place.  
"Indeed I can, sir," cried Bart.  
"But you will lose no time, sir?"  
yes," said the Doctor, laughing.  
Sitting down in a chair too!  
The governor is waiting."  
Don't you be afraid, my boy.  
said the governor, smiling.  
Keep up well with the waggons, and--halt!  
"Forward, or we shall be killed."  
"That I will, Beaver," cried Bart.

So you see you _were_ naughty.  
"Oh, _may_ I have what I want?  
"Hope they won't, any of 'em!  
Milly peeped up in surprise.  
And I _thought_ you's agoin' with me.  
"Well, I was only in fun.  
But they wanted  
me to stay _orf'ly_!"  
Flaxie winked hard, trying not to cry.  
Freddy threw back his shoulders.  
Flaxie thought she was very happy.  
"Oh, yes'm, oh, very long!  
Nobody knows it  
but me!"  
"Oh, don't hold me, don't hold me!  
_Let_ me go to my mamma!"  
What makes you come home with us?  
Flaxie may go with me if  
she likes."  
I didn't s'pose she lived in Hilltop."

"Oh yes'm, I do, I do!"  
"Why, what's the matter now?"

"Well, I didn't mean anything.  
There was no doubt about it.

"Oh, hush, dear; you shake the bed."  
"Well, don't set it on fire."

I should so like to hear it."  
"Ah, good morning, little maid!"

"Yes, sir," a little sadly.  
"How I should like to see her!"  
"Ten, if you please," she answered.

I seem to have heard there did."  
"Ah, did we but know English!  
"Do you know what she says, sir?"  
"Ah, what can be the matter?"  
It surely cannot be true?"  
Alma too looked greatly shocked.  
"Murder a praiseworthy deed!"  
"Oh, sir, how very dreadful!"  
And you wouldn't mind that,  
would you?"  
"That is well," he responded.  
"How do you like housekeeping?"  
"How very industrious!"  
what do _I_ care about it?  
How good in him to say that!  
"How many of them there are!

"Lulu, why can't you

"Yes, mamma," Grace responded submissively.  
Mr. Dinsmore shook his head.  
"I wish I could," said Lulu, dejectedly.  
Evelyn tried to help her.  
"Yes, mamma, dear, what is it?"  
"Yes, I should," returned Rosie.  
"Oh, isn't this just the loveliest, _loveliest_ country!"  
"Two questions at a time, Max!"  
I'd rather be with the girls."  
he exclaimed with emotion.  
"Yes; oh, I am glad for him!"  
They were pleased, too, with Oakdale.  
cried Violet  
in distress.  
Will that answer, Violet?"  
"But you will be on your guard?"  
"Did he really strike you, Lu?"  
"I hope you returned the blow?  
"Never mind who," said Lulu.  
The boy was sorely troubled.  
But no, where would be  
the use?  
"Do the fingers feel better?"  
Did it hurt you very much?"  
"Good-evening," he replied, with a stiff nod.  
Mr. Dinsmore frowned darkly.  
"Were you not told to do so?"  
"And did not choose to obey?  
"Please, Lu, let me in," she cried.  
How find shelter, food, clothing?  
"Is Lulu going away?"  
asked Max, looking at Lulu.  
"Thank you, no," Violet said.  
"Max, my boy, how came you here?"  
she asked, clutching at his arm.  
"O Max, what about papa?"  
Oh, Max, Max, what shall I do?  
"I needn't say much--need I, Max?"  
"Something you'll be glad to

"What's he going to tell?"  
Do try to hope for the best.

THE LAST OF THE OLD CAPTAIN.  
"What are the open hurdles?"  
says Captain Cusack, kindly.  
"Not at all," says the captain.  
"Then is the hurdles over?"  
You never saw such a race!  
Bloomfield had cut out grandly.  
"Well run, Ashley; keep it up!  
Amid such shouts the race ends.  
Everything seemed against him.  
They might as well try Riddell.  
Parson knew them yards away.  
"Doesn't much matter," said Parson, resignedly.  
I suppose it's Bloomfield."  
"What's that to do with it?  
asked Coates, with a slight sneer.  
"Porter's right," said Bloomfield.  
Pity for them to get stale."  
"Come out of there, do you hear?  
Any more sherbet left, King?"  
"Won't wash again," cried Parson.  
"Very," said Mrs Patrick.  
Is the schoolhouse boat to win?"  
"Very," chimed in Miss Stringer.  
He was not cut out for it.  
But he made one more effort.  
It's worth trying, Riddell."  
"Look out, Porter's looking."  
"We can resign, I suppose?"  
said Bloomfield; "don't begin by quarrelling."  
you aren't captain yet, old man!"  
"But what do you want to say?"  
Two to one on Parrett's!  
"Isn't old Bloomfield a stunner?"  
let's land and have a mill!"  
"I'll apologise, you know."  
Dare you to run into us!  
"What did he say the time was?"  
We can't do it in the time!"  
"So shall I be," said Bosher.  
he called out as they approached.  
We didn't know it was you, sir.  
We're awfully sorry, sir."  
"It was all our faults," said Lawkins.  
We ran you down on purpose."  
inquired Mr Parrett.  
"He'd better not," said Parson.  
I say I'm getting fagged of impots.  
"That's just the worst of it.  
"Ha, ha," said Silk, "it wasn't bad.  
Something's sure to turn up.  
"Yes," said Bloomfield, "I heard that."  
"Let them grind," said Game, laughing.  
It was a beastly low trick!"  
I shan't be able to cox.  
Isn't that what he said, you chaps?"  
"Gave Cattermole and Watkins a hiding."  
It's head of the river."  
("Oh no, not yet," from Fairbairn.)  
"Well, it will be very soon.  
member seconds the motion."  
Do you really, gentlemen?  
I could not have believed it.  
(Loud laughter from the schoolhouse.)  
It is time the Welchers had a word!"  
"It's all very well," screamed Pilbury.  
Pilbury scowled fiercely at the speaker.  
It was hot and exciting.  
"Order, order," cried Isaacs.  
That's all I have to say."  
I see what you mean," said Pil.  
I'm getting sick of rows."  
Any chap can fool about.  
"Awfully brickish of you, Philpot."  
"What are you trying to do?"  
The effect was magical.  
Serves you right, Pil, so it does."  
What's all the spread out for?"  
"Hope it'll flare-up like the other," said Pilbury.  
"Oh, Phil, old man, are you hurt?  
We're so awfully sorry.  
WYNDHAM JUNIOR AND HIS FRIENDS.  
How I'd like to comfort him!  
"Oh, I must go," said Wyndham.  
"I don't want to offend him."  
"Kind of you," said Silk, laughing.  
Wyndham blushed, but said nothing.  
"He's the Aquarium!"  
You hadn't a permit, had you?"  
I beg your pardon, Riddell."  
said Riddell, "don't do that, please."  
"I want to ask your advice."  
"I know who you mean--Tedbury, isn't it?"  
"Are you making all this up?"  
asked Riddell, after a pause.  
"I know," said Riddell, kindly.  
How would you like to take it?"  
"Takes a lot of time, doesn't it?"  
And he might well be anxious!  
"He had a permit, hadn't he?"  
said Wyndham, rather concerned.  
"Why, is it a bad place, then?"  
"Hooked him, I fancy," said Silk.  
But Fairbairn reasoned him down.  
"Of course I am," said Fairbairn.  
"Try him without the rudder.  
Richard was himself again.  
"Who's that digging behind?"  
cried Fairbairn, stretching forward.  
"Riddell, will you come and cox.  
"Yes; I shall try him for bow."  
demanded Gilks, threateningly.  
"I'm awfully sorry."  
"For all we know they may win.  
"Just the man I was afraid.  
Go at once, for goodness' sake."  
"Then you _were_ playing the fool?"  
BLOOMFIELD IN TRIBULATION.  
"You should have seen our boat!  
Nor was he disappointed.  
exclaimed King, in amazement.  
"Cut it," said Telson; "I'm busy."  
shouted Telson back from where he sat.  
It was even past a joke.  
Why should he be unhappy?  
That too was preposterous.  
But the boat-race was now coming on.  
"Why don't you ask young Parson?"  
suggested Telson, innocently.  
he's not a schoolhouse kid."  
"How jolly early you are!"  
"Who are you, my little dear?"  
"I mean, you know, the fellows--?"  
"And where do you live at home?"  
"Parson coxes for Parrett's," said Telson.  
Now, my love--now, Miss Stringer."  
Then Telson said, "That was young Wyndham!"  
"It'll be a shave if they do.  
Riddell was sorry for this.  
He had hoped the boy would stay.  
Young muller, couldn't steer a tub."  
"Ye-ow, look at them--there's a lot!"  
"Now, boss Riddell--mind your eye.  
"Yes; no mistake about it!"  
"How long before we see them?"  
Neither spoke for a minute.  
An anxious minute followed.  
A loud laugh greeted the threat.  
"He'd stick at nothing, I know."  
"Sorry for him if I did!"  
"Have them over, Parrett's!"  
"Nobody will believe them."  
"Yes, I think so," said Fairbairn.  
"We can't help that," said Riddell.  
"It's the least we can do."  
"Oh, rather; that's settled.  
"It seemed a clean cut, didn't it?"  
"Have you found out who did it?"  
"Well, I don't blame them--do you, Gilks?"  
"A Welcher might," suggested Telson.  
"What would be the good to him?  
"And do you think we funk you?  
I say we didn't do it; there!"  
King was there eating toffee.'"  
"`At breakfast sit opposite Telson.  
exclaimed Parson, looking up.  
I answered nay I had not.  
"Why, I see it," said Parson.  
"Don't be an ass, Parson," said Telson.  
he exclaimed, "the Welchers are coming!"  
So they'll be here directly."  
"What shall we do, you fellows?"  
They won't be up to it, eh?"  
cried a mocking voice--"won't wash!  
"Tell you it won't wash, my boy!"  
"I didn't say I didn't, did I?"  
said Telson, "and give them a start too."  
demanded Mr Parrett.  
"For the Parretts, sir," broke in Cusack.  
"And now just listen to me.  
I have not much fear myself."  
The morning will do, won't it?"  
It wasn't my fault, I tell you.  
Gilks called him back for a moment.  
"_You_ took me--you made me go."  
"Will he let out, do you think?"  
"I'll see," said Silk, not very assuringly.  
"It depends," said he, coolly.  
He drew from it a post-office order.  
"It's for three pounds," he said.  
"I was going to change it to-morrow."  
THE NEW CAPTAIN TURNED WELCHER.  
"Ah, Riddell, glad to see you.  
Riddell was soon at his ease.  
Was he in jest or earnest?  
said Pilbury, "we do as we like here."  
"No more do I," said Philpot.  
"I don't think so," said Riddell.  
But I tell you what I'll do.  
"So will we," said the others.  
(Tremendous Parrett's cheers.)  
You know as well as I do.  
It was unpatriotic.  
They're beginning already."  
No one expected they would.  
"Howling young Radical cad!"  
"Don't tell crams," cried the others.  
"I'll be anything you like.  
"`Thursday, the 4th day of the week.'"  
broke in the outraged Parson.  
"No, no; read fair; do you hear?"  
"`Wyndham hath not found his knife.  
The words struck him like a knife.  
He hurried out of his room.  
Riddell imagined too much.  
You got it worse than he did."  
Did any one else see it?"  
And Fairbairn promised and went.  
"But I say, were you much hurt?"  
A MYSTERIOUS LETTER.  
"What are you talking about?"  
"Is Cheeseman in, can't you hear?"  
"Eight hundred and twenty-five!"  
Was it another lecture?  
"Please, sir," said he, "we've brought the impositions."  
But it had turned out neither.  
"Jolly time you've had of it."  
I could hardly hold the bat.  
I say, isn't it prime, Riddell?  
"Did he bowl you any balls?"  
"_You_ in the first eleven!  
Wyndham went soon afterwards.  
so you're a-goin' in for scullin' then?"  
I thought it would come to that!"  
Always the way with you chaps!"  
"In course it was," replied he, surlily.  
What 'ud I know anythink about it for?  
"How do you suppose I know?"  
again repeated Riddell.  
I want to know who it was."  
"But you let him into the boat-house?"  
"That's where you're wrong again.  
"There you are, all wrong agin.  
Why, you aren't been right once yet."  
I tell you I didn't see him.  
"There you go; you're so clever.  
"And have you got it still, Tom?"  
Here Tom began to get shy.  
There was no mistaking it.  
"You'd scarcely guess--from Bloomfield.  
But there was no such excuse.  
cried some one, sarcastically.  
"No one knows exactly why."  
"It doesn't do you any harm."  
"Yes, I hope so," said Wyndham.  
Do you know about it, then?"  
Oh what a fool I have been!"  
And next moment he was gone.  
What must his state of mind be?  
I'd be awfully obliged."  
We'd be a `party' you know!"  
But now he hardly heard it.  
(Terrific Skyrocket cheers.)  
(Tremendous cheers from the club.)  
("We don't know what we're doing?")  
Is Welch's going to win?"  
They're in no end of a rage."  
"Why doesn't he tell who it is?"  
What did Riddell want him for?  
said the captain, nervously.  
But do let us off this time!  
"So am I," said the captain.  
And yet he hesitated.  
"Have you got it out of him?"  
"Of course he is," said Ashley.  
he demanded, not very encouragingly.  
"What's that to do with me?"  
Wyndham looked up in surprise.  
That is, if it all came out.  
"Ah, Wyndham, so you've come back?"  
"As far as you are concerned!  
because if you have, I haven't."  
Let's see, how much was it?"  
Yet it seemed his only hope.  
And yet, what _would_ Riddell think?  
"You did it splendidly, young 'un!  
cried Wyndham, passionately.  
No, I think I won't just now."  
"I am now a skyrocket.  
Riddell it seems hath cut the rudder-lines.  
I taketh them and am out."  
I beg your pardon, that is."  
demanded Mrs Patrick.  
So, at least, they imagined.  
"My dear, have you done your tea?"  
"I beg your pardon, indeed!"  
asked Bloomfield, somewhat coldly.  
"Of course," replied the captain.  
In proof of which here he was.  
"We may as well have breakfast.  
I've told them so more than once."  
"I'll fight you, you know, Parson!"  
asked the captain, quietly.  
I say, isn't it frightful bosh?"  
"Of course you were," said Wyndham.  
"I'm ashamed to say it."  
Last time was nothing to it!"  
So it was a packed meeting.  
"Then the shindy began," said Parson.  
You never saw such a lark!"  
"They tried to stop him at that.  
"`You can't stop the business now.  
continued Mr Parrett.  
A CLIMAX TO EVERYTHING.  
"Well, let him show off; who cares?"  
Is it true you've had a row?"  
Things can't be worse than they are.  
"And did you tell him he might?"  
I wish to goodness he would."  
demanded Silk, angrily.  
"Do you know what he's done?"  
"No, I don't; and I don't care."  
You know what you are saying?"  
"And you know what I shall do?"  
"Yes, you'll tell--"  Silk's face fell.  
Silk's manner changed once more.  
I'm bound to report it."  
Have you sent the name up yet?"  
And two things seemed pretty clear.  
One other thing was clear too.  
"You heard of the fight last night?"  
Wyndham's face changed colour.  
Hold my towel, do you mind?  
Gilks used his right too much, you know.  
"Do you mind taking a turn?  
I want to tell you something."  
"There goes the bell," said Bloomfield.  
"That's just the worst of it.  
"A few days before the boat-race, sir.  
The doctor nodded his head.  
"I suppose you can't come too?"  
But you stay till the morning.  
It's quieter than this."  
Never mind; it can't be helped.  
"What's that you said just now?"  
"I only said, `Kick him out!'"  
demanded he, in a rage.  
That's all I've got to say!"  
WILLOUGHBY HERSELF AGAIN.  
"There's another two for Tedbury.  
There's no room; we're full up."  
We'd better cheer him, I say."  
"Oh, I heard it," said the boy.  
At least, that's my notion!"

Henty     PREFACE   To my Young Readers.  
Try to keep out of scrapes, boys.  
The hours went slowly on.  
"Lie still, Rhoda," Tom whispered.  
They will stop at their stable.  
"Shall I help you up, Rhoda?"  
"Jack, hold the leader's head.  
"How far is it to aunt's?"  
This is a jolly room, Tom."  
It is a very old name."  
Miss Scudamore was silent for some time.  
"This is luck, Peter," Tom said.  
"You miserable coward!"  
"Look here, and mark my words well.  
Miss Scudamore looked steadily at them.  
Do you mean to go to sea?"  
"Quite right," Captain Manley said.  
The colonel looked up and smiled.  
"I don't think so, sir," Tom said.  
"Tom and Peter," Tom answered.  
The boys looked at each other.  
"I was thinking as much, sir."  
They are most anxious to learn.  
There was a general laugh.  
There was a general laugh.  
There was a roar of laughter.  
"But what makes them come here as buglers?"  
One of them is called Peter.  
"What's to be done, Manley?"  
There was a cry of "a fight!"  
"No, I won't," Mitcham answered.  
He can't hold out much longer."  
I wonder who it has been.  
"Mitcham's nearly a man.  
"How did you learn to do that?"  
"I had not seen you before.  
"This is splendid, Tom, isn't it?"  
"Look, Tom, Sam's overboard!"  
Then they had time to look round.  
So we must keep watch and watch.  
Take the things out of the net."  
"So do I, Tom," Peter said.  
"Mind how you do it, Peter.  
the captain said in surprise.  
"What can the men be up to?"  
"I am very glad you did.  
"No, not that I have heard of.  
What is the matter with them?"  
"I do believe he means the Scudamores!  
Come to me to-morrow with your brother.  
The regiment is dismissed."  
I says, 'Cluck means yes, I suppose?'  
A PAUSE IN OPERATIONS.  
Besides, who would suspect boys?  
repeated Colonel Tritton vaguely.  
"You are poor; how can you pay?"  
I owe him twelve thousand now.  
No, no, you must stay behind.  
"But what you do without Sam?  
"Is it all right, Garcias?"  
Tom gave him the little quill.  
"Do you speak Spanish, madam?"  
What is this fierce crowd about?"  
Nunez shrieked; "lower your guns.  
Are you ready, Garcias!"  
She looks a lady, poor thing.  
Who can she be, I wonder?"  
"Look you," he said to the men.  
Keep your hand on your pistol."  
And now about your journey.  
the general asked sharply.  
"A likely story that, Sam.  
says the ole woman, 'what you want?  
"What will be the end of it?"  
"I do not know," Major Fanshawe said.  
"Good ting, dat, Massa Peter.  
You accept the appointments?"  
Will you join me at daybreak to-morrow?  
"Seize de debil!--seize him!--he gone mad!"  
"He'll come round all right," he said.  
"He is very kind," Tom said.  
Tom bent down over Peter.  
Tom repeated with disgust.  
But I must be going now.  
Peter was still unconscious.  
Rhoda said, when he came up.  
CIUDAD RODRIGO AND BADAJOS.  
"There are a lot of remounts landed to-day.  
was the general question.  
He is off to bed early.  
"Sam, there's something wrong here!"  
"There," he said, "just as I thought."  
For some time there was silence.  
He trabel night, hide up at day time.  
"Your pardon," Tom said humbly.  
She glanced through it and turned pale.  
And now let's have dinner."  
Massa Tom get here too late."  
It was as he imagined.  
"Were they making fun of you?"  
Den Sam point to de feathers.  
Peter said in a choked voice.  
he demanded angrily.  
"It will be all right," Walsh said.

There was silence in the tent.  
"They are terrible beasts," Malchus said.  
Three of our men were killed."  
"It is a mere nothing," Giscon said.  
Hamilcar recoiled a step as if struck.  
he exclaimed, "can this be so?  
"It is a terrible blow.  
"So, here you are again, Malchus," Adherbal said.  
"I thought you would soon be back.  
You hear what my lord Malchus tells us.  
"That is just what I want," Malchus said.  
Hanno's faction was not idle.  
"How it happened they know not.  
"That I swear solemnly," Malchus said.  
Each man shifted for himself.  
The troops lived and slept on deck.  
"Where is the country of the Vacaei?"  
I hope some day to try it.  
"What a savage looking race!"  
He gave a cry of horror.  
"Dead," Malchus said--"devoured by wolves."  
"My plans must not yet be known.  
Saguntum stood as an outpost of Rome.  
Hannibal asked that evening.  
The slave at once opened it.  
The siege had lasted eight months.  
Nessus exclaimed as Malchus hurried along.  
"My lord is not hurt, I hope?"  
First, though, I will blow my horn.  
Only once did Nessus have to shoot.  
"They will soon be after us."  
He returned in a minute.  
For hours it continued.  
I cannot do it myself."  
They were now free to look round.  
"It is useless, Nessus," Malchus said at last.  
Then I went to the entrance.  
It was strongly fortified.  
So that is how the wind lies.  
It is one of great danger.  
This was lighted by torches.  
"It is I, Nessus," the voice replied.  
"Have you found a hiding place, Nessus?"  
"It is in the reservoirs.  
When he awoke it was day.  
"I must wait till I am free.  
You would obtain no hearing.  
"The prospects are bad," he said.  
the Roman officer asked.  
They lived in beehive shaped huts.  
"What do you think of doing, Malchus?"  
"None assuredly," Sempronius replied.  
"A few words only," Malchus answered.  
"I was brought here three months since."  
She is very beautiful."  
What will then be said of your manliness?  
Julia asked passionately.  
Julia said passionately.  
You are mad, girl, and shameless."  
I want them separated."  
Sempronius stood for a moment in doubt.  
Clotilde had by this time gained her feet.  
"Go," she said, "and summon Clotilde here."  
Now we will be off at once."  
"How can I go in like this?"

The mind is like the body.  
The wind was blowing strongly.  
"Why, what would they say at home?  
Make as much haste as you can."  
The snow was falling fast now.  
"Do you know where we are, Tom?"  
"Not in the least," Tom answered.  
"There is no shepherd's hut.  
What on earth are we to do?"  
What are you thinking about?  
There seems a faint sort of light.  
"I shall eat some snow," Tom said.  
"Can they be alive down there?"  
"The two Jacksons and Humphreys."  
"Under the snow all this time!"  
They are snowed up in a hut.  
A loud cheer broke from the men.  
"Yes, sir," Mr Humphreys said.  
"I can take her anywhere.  
"This is awful, Dick," he said.  
"That no one can say, my boy.  
This is the form of contract.  
(_Headquarters, Thring's Post, Lower Tugela_.)  
(_Headquarters, Helpmakaar, near Rorke's Drift.)  
Royal Artillery.--N.  
At sunset they descended.  
Look, they are close to the camp!"  
"It is frightful, frightful, Tom!  
"Whatever shall we do, Dick?"  
The Zulus hesitated.  
The Zulus swarmed after them.  
The scene here was terrible.  
Assegais were planted in the bottom.  
Not a carbine was loaded!  
Many gallant deeds were done.  
A TRADING EXPEDITION.  
Dick went to bed in high glee.  
Mr Harvey asked, smiling.  
The new-comers at once opened fire.  
"Are their skins worth anything?"  
There was an instant stampede.  
AN ATTACK BY ELEPHANTS.  
Now tell me all about it."  
Dick asked, as the firing ceased.  
"Is it a serious wound?"  
Dick and Tom at once fired.  
"Sure to do dat," Jumbo said.  
The journey was now resumed.  
"What do you think of affairs?"  
"I don't know what is best, Dick.  
Mr Harvey looked up now.  
"Storm come, sir; very bad storm.  
Jumbo exclaimed suddenly.  
"Accordingly we started.  
It was a terrible day.  
Say you forgive me, my boy.'  
I don't remember much more.  
It was a near squeak, wasn't it?  
"Well, I hope you are wrong, Dick.

It is a temperance  
tract."  
"Hold on, mother, you'll bust me!"  
are _you_ one o' the hands, Joe?"  
No  
idlers allowed on board, you know."  
A CONTRAST TO CHAPTER I.  
"Why did you deceive me, dear?"  
"I live nowheres in par-tickler," answered the boy.  
I know one who'll just suit you.  
"Does a Miss Seaward live here?"  
I must just grin and bear it.  
The sisters made no reply.  
My top-coat stuffed in'll put  
that to rights.  
I leave smokin' to steam-funnels, an' drinkin' to

"All right--an' what sort o' rig?  
I couldn't go in them 'ere slops, you  
know.  
"What's this i' the soup, Nell?"  
"That's just what we does, Miss.  
asked Billy in some surprise.  
Billy was taken aback.  
Now,  
will you, or will you not?  
"I prefer Billy," said Kate.  
Will you stay and dine with us?  
Pulling his forelock he left the room.  
asked the captain anxiously.  
as Hamlet said to the  
ass."  
Did I ever  
show it you?  
"Well, then, notice what I do."  
he shouted, rising promptly.  
"Well, it is a bit heavy.  
We never saw him again."  
Billy needed no caution.  
It was twenty fathoms long.  
"Here, Luke Trevor, mind the helm."  
"Play when your work  
is done, boys."  
P'raps he's got letters for us."  
"For both," shouted Frost, promptly.  
"Your cheek has been growin' too, Billy."  
The vessel was accepted.  
When this was said, "Praise the Lord!"  
But he has _not_ done his best.  
"Did I say it was, old boy!"  
The voice belonged to Gunter.  
"Choke him off," cried David Bright.  
"They might be worse," replied Ned.  
"What smack does it come from,  
think 'ee?"  
"His accordion," said Ned.  
There's no mistakin' Singin' Peter's voice.  
Their bark is worse than their bite."  
The tiller fell to leeward.  
"That's good," said Ruth, laughing.  
They would not accept money.  
"Nothing easier, Miss Ruth.  
"And how much is the gold worth?"  
"That's more than I can tell.  
"And don't know who she married?"  
Another potato--thank 'ee."  
returned the captain  
gravely.  
The captain heaved a deep sigh.  
"I'll trust you for that," said Ruth.  
"What say ye, lad, to a hymn?"  
I'm not a bit sleepy."  
It was answered from above.  
There were sudden screams and cries.  
"Der you go agin, Billy.  
That's enough, stir him up.  
if there ain't _empty_ bookshelves!"  
Appalling is a mild word.  
It is not appropriate.  
"No, you never told me that."  
So did the rest of the crew.  
"The Coper's close on the port bow!"  
Come, we must git him aboard sharp.  
One or two attempts were made.  
"How many hands you tink I've got?"  
`Oh, never mind that,' says we, laughin'.  
`We won't be  
par-tickler how he does it.  
"P'r'aps not," said Zulu, with a grin.

"Do it yourself, boy," said Joe.  
cried Zola, lookin' wild, `de skipper!  
"It was soon over with _him_!"  
"When these are worn-out he can have more."  
You can't work wi' that hand, you know.  
Fishing was  
impossible.  
But why think of such nonsense?  
I've  
often wondered at it.  
See, daddy's a-goin' to show his-self off."  
"An' I've signed the pledge too, lass."  
"D'you mean the boy with the boots on?"  
"Well, now, that _is_ a stumper!"  
"Never, Miss, as I can reck'lect on.  
We'll make you r'free--umpire--to shettle

Gunter was fierce by  
nature.  
Get on your bonnet, Jessie."  
I'll _never_ do it again!"  
A HOPEFUL CLUB DISCOVERED.  
All my relations are dead.  
cried the captain, starting up.  
"Impossible; thank'ee, I'm an abstainer."  
"Was there much powder in 'em?"  
The captain sighed profoundly.  
Don't give up hope, however.  
THE WRECK OF THE EVENING STAR.  
asked the other in surprise.  
exclaimed a voice eagerly.  
they murmured, but said no more.  
But there was no need for words.  
Did any  
of 'ee hear o' that?"  
Abel,' says I, `is that you?'  
`Leastwise it's all that's  
left o' me.'  
"`How did it happen, Abel?'  
"Yes, sir," she said,--and vanished.  
"Mr and Mrs Dalton!"  
"Well, now, this _is_ capital!  
I'm not usin'  
figures o' speech.  
OUT WITH THE SHORT BLUE AGAIN.  
There's the fleet at last, sir!"  
"I'll wait," returned Captain Bream.  
"Is he a man or a boy?"  
"Won't you  
come after service?  
"Don't commit yourself,  
Gunter.  
Gunter knew well what was meant.  
why, her name's Bright, of course."  
that's it--nearly, at least.  
asked the captain anxiously.  
Widow Bright lives there, don't she?"  
For three seconds this lasted.  
Praise the Lord

Why, she got in a passion."  
"Sorry I kept you, father.

said Kenneth, with his mouth full.  
"Why, Donald says--"  "Tut, tut, tut!  
"Wonder what's the matter!"  
Did you invite him, father?"  
That ejaculation, pah!

"No, the boat; coming by the Grenadier."

"Put on your shoes and stockings."  
"There, you can do the same, Dirk.  
It's boat day," said Kenneth.  
"I'll let you see," cried Kenneth.  
A perfect volley of barks.  
She'd bite you if you wass near."  
Dessay it was," said Kenneth, yawning.  
"I can see her red funnel."  
I say, Scood, why shouldn't I shoot you?"  
"Wonder whether you'd be tough."  
"Wait and eat him," said Scood, grinning.  
"Did we get all your luggage?"  
"Oh!--Are you Mr Kenneth Mackhai?"  
"To--to go on to the house.  
"Thank you, I'm much obliged.  
Look, you can see the whirlpools.

"Is--is there any danger?"  
"Have you--a basin on board?"  
he said; "you keep a stout heart.  
It's safer like this--eh, Scood?"  
"Is--is the grey mare ashore?"  
"Is--is there any danger?"  
"Yes; and boats too, like this--eh, Scood?"  
"I say, your name's Blande, isn't it?"  
"I say, who's your father?"  
"Mr Blande of Lincoln's Inn.  
"Well, I call them Macbrayne's pigeons."  
"Are we going ashore here?"  
"She'll go town, and we must swim."  
"Had the boat full; that's all.  
You said you could swim, didn't you?"  
"Ah, well, it don't matter now!  
Scood and I can soon teach you that."  
"Where would the boat have come up?"  
"N-n-no," said Kenneth cavalierly.  
"Oh, I don't know," said Kenneth.  
We ought to shorten ta sail."  
"She'll go over, and you'll trown the chentleman!"  
Old Coolin Cumstie never had a castle.  
"And she can tie like a mans.  
Can you see the North Pole yet, Scood?"  
Max thought it was to his room.  
"Why, the sea's all round us!"  
"That's in London, isn't it?  
You are so far from the rail."  
Walter Scott would do for you."  
"But you brought a lot of rods."  
But I caught him all the same."  
"Oh, I say, you are comic!"  
Donald is our piper."  
He took to it to play in.  
Just time to have a wash first.  
What's your name, did you say?"  
"You should have had it cut short.  
It's better for bathing.  
This is not a lobster shore.  
a very beautiful fall."  
"What--what--what's the matter?"  
why, you were asleep again.  
"We must say good-night to your father."  
he won't like to be disturbed.  
"Oh yes, I always have one."  
Like to have another nap?"  
You don't want a bathing-gown," cried Kenneth.  
ejaculated Max, who seemed struck almost dumb.  
"But--"  "You're not afraid, are you?"  
He has gone down," cried Kenneth.  
Lay hold of that bit of stone.  
There's plenty of room here."  
asked Max, so as to gain time.  
"Why, what a fellow you are!"  
"There, you can touch bottom here.  
that's better," cried Kenneth.  
"He says, was he nearly drowned?"  
Strike out, and try to get in."  
"No, you shan't; I won't let you.  
"Don't be too particular.  
"Comb it when you get indoors.  
Don't you see it saves the bread?  
Why, it's just what you want.  
See how white and thin you are."  
I always take mine with me."  
"No, father, not half a one."  
"Oh, thank you, I am indeed."  
"I'll take care of him, father."  
What are you going to do to-day?"  
"How about the deer, father?"  
"I'll teach you to fight, my lad.  
Max, let me introduce you.  
"Oh yes, very," replied Max.  
"Never mind old Shon, Tavish.  
so you have," replied Kenneth.  
"But--"  "Well, you are a coward!  
cried the old man, firing up.  
"How does that old man manage?"  
"Then he is not always there?"  
said Max, with a helpless look.  
"Why don't you dress like I do?  
cried Kenneth, with suppressed mirth.  
Why, half the people go bare-legged here.  
Slip on your socks and shoes now.  
"Well, now, do just as I do.  
"Is this a salmon leap, then?"  
"She mustn't splash the watter," said Tavish sententiously.  
"She nearly hookit her in the nose!"  
"And you threw ten times better.  
"Yes; that's a splendid stand."  
"Am I to fish with a flea?"  
Keep the point o' yer rod oop.  
Keep oop the point o' yer rod, laddie.  
"It's a rare big one, Max."  
Na it's a fush, and a gude fush.  
"The watter always mak's the stanes wet."  
"Oh, I ken the noo," cried Tavish.  
Pull oot some more line, laddie, and do't again."  
"There, she will hae the fush directly.  
"But I did try," said Max in remonstrance.  
cried Tavish excitedly.  
cried Tavish, stamping with rage.  
An' dinna catch haud too tight o' the line."  
Wind in, and keep a tight line."  
Let's ket her on to ta rock."  
cried Tavish indignantly.  
"Leuk at that, maister," cried Scood excitedly.  
"Can ye set any more free, Scood?"  
"Stan' up, laddie, and get on my pack.  
I ken the size," cried Tavish.  
"Nay, Maister Kenneth, I winna gie him a taste.  
"Ta fush weighs three-an'-twenty pun' and nae mair, Maister Kenneth."  
"Ask Tavish," was the reply.  
"He'll tell you to a pound, sir."  
"Well, be civil to him, Ken.  
Why does he have him here, then?  
Shall I run up to his room?"  
"Thank you," said Max politely.  
"I beg your pardon," he said.  
It has been such a hard day."  
Max started and turned scarlet.  
These strokes are easy enough.  
Then a reaction set in.  
"P'r'aps Grant is busy with father.  
What do you want--hot water?"  
"Thank you," said Max hastily.  
"Are you sure you sent them down?  
Jump into another pair.  
"Oh no, that would never do!"  
"Pop on your knickerbockers."  
Shall I put on my dress things?"  
The gong will go directly."  
"I--I--oh dear!--oh, oh, oh!  
"That dog took hold of my leg."  
said Kenneth seriously.  
"Here, Max, let's go and see."  
The effect was magical.  
"Put away that knife, Scood, and run!"  
"She'll niver rin frae ta auld piper!"  
"Go on down, and she shall come aifter.  
"Don't set the dog at me, please."  
"Where would you go if we sailed?"  
"In the case in my bedroom.  
I'll give you plenty of time.  
"Ta wint's going to change."  
Ta wint's going to change."  
Well, Sneeshing, can you see anything?"  
"Oh, it's easy enough.  
"There's another yonder."  
This one on the island is Turkree.  
That's where the eagles build."  
"I can see that quite plainly."  
How is it they've come down here?"  
He was cross when he said that."  
Like fishing for mackerel?"  
"I never did fish for them."  
"That's the cock," cried Kenneth.  
Now, then, how shall we get 'em?"  
"Well, how are we to get them?"  
You could climb that, couldn't you, Max?"  
"Na, she isna feared, but she couldna do it."  
"Oh, you'll soon dry up again.  
We're nearly up at the top."  
"Why, what are you afraid of?"  
"Well," cried Kenneth, "come along!  
cried Kenneth, wiping his eyes.  
But how about the young birds?  
"She says she shall not come," cried Scoodrach.  
"I say, Scoody, why did the rope break?"  
But what a ding I gave my airm!"  
I say, Scoody, think we could climb up?"  
Oh, what a ding she gave her airm!"  
"Here, Max, what's to be done?"  
"I'll run back and tell them at Dunroe."  
"I forgot the loch," he said.  
It was most enjoyable.  
"I did, but it was no use."  
"She pulls oot ta cork to let ta watter oot.  
"Ye'll know next time what to do."  
"And she sailed pack all py herself?"  
"Na; reading a pit latter."  
"What's coming to ta man?"  
Kenneth is waving his cap."  
I left them for you to bring."  
"I believe you went to sleep.  
Here, Tavvy, give us hold of the rope."  
shouted Kenneth from below.  
The outlook was most dismal.  
It's quite rough even there.  
"What's the matter, Tonal'?"  
"You, Tonal', what do you want?"  
"But ta chiel' lo'es ta pipes," cried Donald.  
"Yes, another time, Tonal'.  
"Here, hold hard a bit, Tawy," he cried.  
"Well, what do you think of it?"  
"That I am a great coward?"  
"No, not there; but you can here."  
"Tell me something I don't know."  
"Scoody and I have often been down."  
"There's chust too much watter in ta way."  
"You're a worse coward than Max."  
cried Scoodrach, stamping his foot with rage.  
some one go for a doctor."  
D'ye think I dinna ken what I'm aboot?"  
Kenneth laddie--Kenneth, my bonnie chiel'!  
To-morrow we must hope for better things."  
The head trouble has passed now.  
an attack upon the place!  
you might have slipped and fallen."  
You haven't tried for the trout yet.  
I want to get well, don't I?  
You might open a window."  
See old Tonal' this morning?"  
You're just like a great girl, Max."  
"Yes, it is very tiring."  
I didn't want you to tell me.  
"Don't say `Yes, Kenneth,' say `Yes.'  
"He does, every morning."  
"Why, you are getting on fast."  
"She's been watching for ye.  
"She's sent her to fetch me?"  
"Oh, I say, this is a treat!"  
Does me more good than old Curzon's dollops.  
"What are you going to do?"  
"Wait a moment, and you'll see.  
cried Kenneth; "it isn't Tonal'."  
"Do you want me to whack you?"  
Why don't you go on throwing?"  
She has not get pack her strength."  
"When do you expect him back?"  
He said it was uncertain.  
Kenneth was more successful.  
said Kenneth excitedly.  
I say, you won't help, will you?"  
cried Kenneth excitedly.  
"No nonsense, please," cried the man.  
"Put that doon, mon," cried the bailiff.  
Noo, ance mair, will ye open the gates?"  
"Oh ay," roared the young gillie.  
Ye'll come doon and open the gates?"  
HOW DONALD PLAYED THE WAR MARCH.  
"Come on, my lads, in with you!"  
"Then let's fetch a latter."  
"Bring some more ammunition.  
Hi, Tonal', play up, auld mon!"  
"What, the broken topmast of the wreck?"  
Cookie, let's have some hot."  
Here, Max, take away that knife."  
You never asked that before."  
Keep it up," cried the bailiff.  
cried Kenneth, taking one arm.  
"Nay, laddie, we dinna want him," said Tavish.  
He's a bit shakkit i' ta pack.  
cried Kenneth excitedly.  
said Kenneth, taking his hand.  
I'll keep it for the bailiffs.  
I don't know about desperate."  
cried Kenneth excitedly.  
"Recollect that you are a Mackhai.  
He cannot rob me of that.  
MAX ASKS THE WAY TO GLASGOW.  
cried Kenneth excitedly.  
He crossed to the bell and rang.  
across the mountain--alone?"  
he could not have been so mad!"  
"And that he might lose his life?"  
"You did it on purpose, then?"  
Please undo this rope; it hurts."  
Noo then, we can get there in twice twa hoors.  
"Oh, father, are we too late?"  
She'll fecht for ta Mackhai till she ties."  
"I daur lay a whole hand on you, Scoody.  
That will do," said The Mackhai sadly.  
"Yes, father, but--"  "Hush, my boy!  
cried Kenneth excitedly.  
said Tavish innocently.  
cried Kenneth; "the light's out."  
Tavish turned to his master.  
"There will be no need, my man.  
"I say, how hot your head is!  
"Yes; so cool and refreshing!"  
"I suppose I am," sighed Max.  
"Yes, I shall, because I must.  
"Come, this is better," he said cheerily.  
Now, shall we forget the past?"  
There, don't turn like that, old chap.  
"Yes, do," cried Max eagerly.  
"Let her go, let her go, Maister Ken!"  
Let her go, and she'll slit her weam!"  
"Hey, but ta Mackhai will never tie!"  
Come, take me for one more ride."  
Scood, my things are packed; fetch them down.  
"But you will not turn them out?"  
"Well, never mind that either.  
"Here, let me show you your room.  
Shall you go down to Dunroe much now?"  
"I hope so--often," said Max.  
I couldn't go and stay there now."  
--Max was holding out his hand.  
"Yes, with delight, old fellow!"  
Why, it must have been just here.

He's a _re-lay-tive_ of yours, isn't he?"  
"Yes; my uncle," I replied.  
Do you know what fevers is?"  
"You warn't with him there, was you?"  
There's lots o' bird-skins to be bought."  
"How far are we from the coast?"  
Who's being bullied now?"  
Here, let me look at your face."  
"Then what had you left undone?"  
"Don't do that," said Uncle Dick.  
"What about humming-birds, uncle," I said.  
"That's right, doctor; you did."  
"I say; doctor, air you mad?"  
But what about fresh water?"  
"That's all, uncle," I said.  
"Horrid bad, sir," he answered.  
"Still of the same mind, doctor?"  
More room to stretch our legs."  
"What was that horrible cry?"  
"But that mournful howl, uncle?"  
They're very peculiar, these night-hawks.  
"Couldn't be one of the great cats?"  
"Not a likely place for one.  
"Like to know exactly, Nat?"  
"We're not going to fire.  
cried my uncle angrily.  
You've got a tongue in your head."  
"No, sir," said the boy promptly.  
"And what did he say to that?"  
"And you followed our boat?"  
"Yes, sir," said the man gruffly.  
said Uncle Dick, suddenly.  
We didn't want to steal the boat.  
"Cannot we keep them, uncle?"  
"Say _yes_, Mr Nat; say _yes_!"  
He will have spoiled the other."  
"All right; I'll go and scrub it."  
You shan't find me ungrateful."  
"What's the other's name?"  
"Where was it stuck on--your back?"  
"Well, what do you make of her?"  
said my uncle; and then, "Look!  
I said, in a sharp whisper.  
I laughed, and laid down my gun.  
"Sure she's gone, Master Nat?"  
"It wasn't our ship at all."  
"He went over somewhere here."  
"Where did the hail come from, Nat?"  
"But did you not see the boat?  
said my uncle angrily.  
Then there was two great monkeys."  
"Are you sure he said that, Pete?"  
Be ready with your gun, Nat.  
"I thought so," said my uncle.  
"I thought so," said my uncle.  
"Well, it's of no good now.  
Shouldn't have liked that, Master Nat.  
"But wapses have their stings in their tails."  
Thought it was golden-green birds with long tails.  
"What shall I do, Master Nat?"  
Look at my neck and shoulder.  
"Oh, yes, you could, sir," he cried.  
Let's get back to the boat.  
"You got off well, Nat," he said.  
"You seem very hard to please."  
"I don't see nothing horrid.  
said the carpenter, staring.  
What is it--granite or gneiss?"  
"Oh, no, just pleasantly cool.  
INTO THE SUNLIGHT AGAIN.  
"Stepped down into some hole, sir.  
"I can see daylight yonder."  
"Oh, yes, sir; I'll try," cried Pete.  
I said, interrupting him.  
I whispered; "Pete sees something.  
I know that sort well enough."  
"Seen or heard anything, Cross?"  
Our task now was simple.  
Seems such a pity, it do."  
"I say, what's in the pot?"  
"No touching while I'm gone."  
"Take care, Cross," cried my uncle.  
Gone, and I'm not loaded.  
There, keep a good heart, my lad.  
"No, I forgot it just then.  
said my uncle eagerly.  
You winged him--I mean legged.  
"Sit still, Nat," said my uncle.  
What are you thinking about?"  
"So you mean to stop here, then?"  
One of the howling monkeys?"  
"But one of us must keep watch to-night."  
"A long way to carry him.  
I cried, imitating him.  
"No; certainly not," I said.  
"In bits, sir," he said, laughing.  
"Going to fire, uncle?"

Abijah Wolf was a Yorkshire woman.  
"I am going out fishing, Abijah."  
"They wouldn't hurt me if I did."  
Tompkins looked round him rather disconcertedly.  
The two boys stopped astonished.  
"That's nowt to oi," the boy said.  
Ned replied indignantly.  
"Thou hast beaten me," he said.  
"Oi've a good moinde to wring yer neck."  
You can say the exact truth.  
"It is dreadful!--quite dreadful!"  
A young woman opened it.  
He ha' been moighty koind to Bill, that chap hav."  
"I ha' no objection, Luke.  
Not a boy moved in his seat.  
The man touched his hat and stopped.  
Captain Sankey shook his head.  
The schoolmaster was silent.  
"Now I want an answer, sir.  
"One word as to punishments.  
A new era had commenced.  
I will take the ten next best.  
"I wonder where he got it.  
He said he had no money."  
Ripon said rather impatiently.  
"I think, Ripon, we ought to speak to Porson."  
"That is the boy," Mr. Porson said.  
"Have mercy, sir, oh, spare me!"  
he said, in a faint whisper.  
She will need all your kindness."  
But Mrs. Sankey liked it.  
what did anything matter!"  
Now all this must have a cause.  
"She means kindly, sir; but, oh!  
I ought not to have done so."  
He was grieved and sore at heart.  
Now it is so different.  
Ned was now nearly sixteen.  
"Don't choke a fellow," he said.  
"Why, what do you mean, Edward?"  
Why shouldn't I marry again?  
what be t' matter with thee?  
Ned walked on without speaking.  
Well, that be bad news, surely!  
Well, well, only to think, now!  
he exclaimed passionately.  
"I wish I could," Ned exclaimed.  
No, I shall just walk about."  
But I must stand by her, too.  
Ned got up and shook himself.  
It will waken thee up like."  
"Do you know what she told me, Abijah?  
I am sorry for you, Ned.  
Some are very heavy ones.  
The wedding was fixed for March.  
Your affectionate nurse, ABIJAH WOLF."  
His wife gave a little cry.  
Even you daren't hit a girl."  
"Not Polly Powlett, I am sure, Bill."  
"No, not Polly," Bill replied.  
"She be a different sort.  
"No great change here," Bill replied.  
Some thowt she would have him, some didn't.  
The request was complied with.  
Oi bee one of them myself."  
It's my way, I suppose.  
I will hurt him more next time."  
"Dang it all, lad, thou speak'st loike a man.  
That's how oi reads it, lass."  
"Well, it may be so," Mary assented.  
You will write, won't you, sometimes?"  
"I moight ha' done it for owt thou know'st, Bill.  
He'd be bound to coom back agin.  
There be never no saying.  
The door, it seems, was open.  
"I think I meant for you, Ned.  
"I am not quite sure myself.  
"I don't feel sleepy, Mr. Porson.  
I don't look like it, do I?"  
Ned's mood had somewhat changed.  
"I will tell him," Dr. Green said.  
We will see," the doctor said.  
"I am almost sure he didn't."  
"That is capital," he said.  
"How did the curtains get drawn?"  
I will take it in myself.  
"I shall enjoy it, doctor.  
the master asked heartily.  
"I am quite well, sir, thank you.  
I knew she would be with me.  
he broke out with a half sob.  
"No, Bill," Mr. Porson said gravely.  
Charlie was the next witness.  
Keep up your spirits, my boy.  
he asked at last abruptly.  
"Thank you," Ned said quietly.  
Mr. Porson said, grasping his hand.  
Not on no account, he said.  
The truth flashed across his mind.  
Ned roused himself at her words.  
It is far from being that.  
You will see when you get back."  
I can't let your father go.  
"Who says as how oi didn't kill Foxey?"  
Come, Luke, it's of no use.  
Besides, I cannot spare you.  
Oi think thou beest wrong, but thou know'st best."  
"It is no use," he replied.  
Ned found this of inestimable benefit.  
One's words war blowed away.  
There was a sharp foight vor a minute.  
Oi picks myself up and vollers him.  
'Be'st a going vor to drown us all?'  
Ned laughed contemptuously.  
They knocked loudly upon it.  
"Is there any answer, sir?"  
"The boy said he was to wait."  
"A singular young fellow!"  
"Have you heard the news, Sankey?"  
"Thou'rt joist in toime, Luke," Bill panted out.  
"Perhaps you are right, Polly.  
"That's roight," Luke said encouragingly; "he be a-cooming round."  
Maybe he won't have nowt said aboot it."  
"Have you sent for the doctor?"  
I will see you tomorrow.  
His eyes presently opened.  
I will be up the first thing."  
She has no friends whatever.  
Accordingly Mrs. Porson called.  
You will come again, won't you?  
"No, Polly; on no account.  
The Luddites are upon you!"  
What brings you back so early?  
you have got blood on your hands!"  
Of course he is unhappy.  
"What is the matter with Bill?"  
"Maister Sankey put me in the roight way.  
"He be one of the best of maisters.  
"Ay, that's all past and gone.  
When you get back send Luke here.  
"Go in to him, Bill," he said hoarsely.  
For God's sake keep him up.  
Here is the deposition.  
"I must go away at once.  
What are you staring there for?  
You can't, indeed," Abijah said, aghast.  
"But where are you going, ma'am?"  
"There is Dr. Green's knock," Abijah said.  
"How are you today, Mrs.  
she cried, "can you forgive me?"

76       PART THREE      My Shore Adventure       13.  
125       PART FIVE      My Sea Adventure       22.  
THE CRUISE OF THE CORACLE  .  
I STRIKE THE JOLLY ROGER .  
IN THE ENEMY'S CAMP  .  
THE TREASURE-HUNT--THE VOICE AMONG             THE TREES  .  
"Were you addressing me, sir?"  
"I must get away from here.  
Between us we raised his head.  
But I'm a saving soul.  
I'm not afraid on 'em.  
I'll tell you if they get that.  
He sits with a drawn cutlass.  
Hold Mrs. Crossley's bag."  
The blind man cursed the money.  
"Flint's fist, I mean," he cried.  
"There's Dirk again," said one.  
Scatter and look for them, dogs!  
"They got the money, you say?  
Hawkins, will you ring that bell?  
Mr. Dance must have some ale."  
"And now, squire," said the doctor.  
"Very well," said the doctor.  
You'll make a famous cabin-boy, Hawkins.  
The ship is bought and fitted.  
"Well, who's a better right?"  
So far there was not a hitch.  
I asked, holding out the note.  
"You didn't know his name, did you?"  
"We was a-talkin' of keel-hauling," answered Morgan.  
That were his name for certain.  
Ah, he looked a shark, he did!  
There's Cap'n Trelawney--what's he to think?  
"To be sure he may," says squire.  
You don't, you say, like this cruise.  
"Like iron," answered the squire.  
"Very good," said the captain.  
"No more I would," cried the squire.  
As it is, I have heard you.  
"You'll find I do my duty."  
And with that he took his leave.  
"You may go below, my man.  
"The old one," cried another.  
It was fairly prosperous.  
Sit you down and hear the news.  
But you smelt powder--didn't you, cap'n?"  
This was how it came about.  
asked Silver derisively.  
"And can you trust your missis?"  
And he turned his quid and spat.  
"Well, I don't say no, do I?"  
But I know the sort you are.  
cried the cook admiringly.  
"That's what I call business.  
"Dick," said Silver, "I trust you.  
I've a gauge on the keg, mind.  
"Thank you, my man," says Captain Smollett.  
Why, it makes me young again.  
Third point, there are faithful hands.  
Now, about the honest hands?"  
It would be pleasanter to come to blows.  
The sun beat full upon them.  
It was all over, I thought.  
"I am sure he would," said I.  
Nor I weren't, neither, I says."  
Theer's where I killed my first goat.  
There was no answer from the forecastle.  
"I'm with you, sir," said he.  
"The tide keeps washing her down.  
"Here come the gigs, sir," said I.  
"Give way, then," cried the captain.  
My lady's maid couldn't miss.  
So far there was no great harm.  
"Nay, mate," returned Ben, "not you.  
he inquired anxiously.  
"I do not know, sir," said I.  
"Ten to one this is a trick."  
Then he hailed the buccaneer.  
Long John answered for himself.  
"A word from you's enough.  
He was whistling "Come, Lasses and Lads."  
"You ain't a-going to let me inside, cap'n?"  
Doctor, here's my service.  
"Right you were, Cap'n Smollett," replied Silver.  
"Well, here it is," said Silver.  
"If Abe Gray--" Silver broke out.  
Now, you'll own that's talking.  
Handsomer you couldn't look to get, now you.  
"Very good," said the captain.  
"Not I," returned the captain.  
Not a man among us moved.  
Then he spat into the spring.  
"That's what I think of ye.  
In the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged.  
"Hawkins hasn't had his breakfast.  
Hunter, take the east side, there.  
"Fire--fire from the house!"  
I opened my eyes at once.  
And if so, where were the men?  
The main-sail hung drooped like a banner.  
She was stock-still but for the current.  
Not a soul was to be seen.  
Hands," I said ironically.  
"To be sure you did," he cried.  
But I'll have to dig for it."  
For God's mercy, Mr.  
Well, come, I take that friendly."  
'Dooty is dooty,' says he, and right he is.  
Says he, 'Cap'n Silver, you're sold out.  
'Well,' says the doctor, 'let's bargain.'  
"It was him that knowed Black Dog."  
"Well, and see here," added the sea-cook.  
Not much worth to fight, you ain't.  
"According to rules," said one.  
They're going to throw me off.  
I'm on squire's side now.  
"Ah, well, he did, though," said he.  
Look here, now; this ain't lucky!  
What fool's cut a Bible?"  
No good'll come o' that, I said."  
"You'll all swing now, I reckon.  
What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?"  
"Belay that talk, John Silver," he said.  
Well, what is it, anyway?  
You'll be cap'n next, I shouldn't wonder.  
"Enough, too," retorted George.  
You say this cruise is bungled.  
Are we a-going to waste a hostage?  
"So that's the toon, is it?"  
But that was never my way.  
And now, shipmates, this black spot?  
cried Dick with a sort of joy.  
Did you take that medicine?  
"Dick don't feel well, sir," said one.  
"If I was I wouldn't say it.  
But no, this here's too much.  
Sure enough, they have the ship.  
There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes."  
I've half a mind to dine first."  
"I don't feel sharp," growled Morgan.  
Well, I reckon he was blue.  
All was clear to probation.  
And he passed me a double-barrelled pistol.  
Morgan found a piece of gold.  
He was brave, and no mistake.  
We must head 'em off the boats."  
And so it's you, Ben Gunn!"  
At the top, the squire met us.  
"Come in, Jim," said the captain.

See, there is my day's work."  
Well, take heart and dig away.  
I cleaned you out yesterday."  
Come, Lantry, get out your scales."  
I don't believe in conscience.  
No, it _is_ Fred, confound  
him!  
"What do you mean by the thief?"  
"Where has he gone to, I say?"  
he repeated, bitterly.  
Then consciousness forsook him.  
Paddy's shout aroused him.  
An' didn't I take ye for  
dead.  
"Now, my young buck," said Crossby, "stand up!  
"Did ye kill that bar all by yerself?"  
exclaimed Gashford, contemptuously.  
"What's that you say, Paddy?"  
is it let him go ye have?  
in the world, I should have said.  
"Has it _really_ come to this?"

But Betty shook him in vain.  
"I won't if I can help it.  
"Surrounded and outnumbered!"  
"No, we can't," shouted Gashford, fiercely.  
"Well, I'll have a look at it."  
exclaimed Flinders, in surprise.  
"D'ee think Gashford would let him out for that?"  
"So you want to buy him off?"  
replied Tom Brixton, in a stern voice.  
a life of crime before me!  
An' we want a few bold  
men."  
"No matter," returned Stalker.  
"You know what we've got to do.  
Are ye all ready now, sor?"  
A large log lay on the ground.  
You'll know it when ye hear it!"  
"I believe you are humbugging us," said Gashford.  
Howld yer tongues, now, an' let _me_ spake.  
demanded the chief, sharply.  
The world lies before you--go!"  
"You know I cannot join you."  
Go; I shall wait here for you."  
If you say, `how shall I act?'  
"Undoubtedly he meant that.  
asked Fred, with a puzzled  
look.  
Betty--dear girl--that was it.  
"Oh that mother were here now!  
dear, dishonoured, but  
still beloved mother!  
"Fetch me the brandy--flask--no?  
"But the matter is urgent!"  
"An' did you camp for the night?"  
It had run away with him.  
It was an awful collapse.  
Of  
_course_ they can't have killed 'em.  
"Well, golden, then, if you will.  
the  
second savage said, "He!"  
Again these children said, "Ho!"  
Brixton had been all but starved to death.  
How my mind seems to wander!  
Not sure that I quote rightly.  
"Ask that of the horse, Tolly."  
They're all blackguards or fools, more or less.  
"Where have you come from, stranger?"  
"An' vere may you be come from?"  
ejaculated Bevan, with an air that betokened doubt.  
"Who told you I left her there?"  
"An' why should I be afraid?"  
it's onkind,  
to say the laste of it.  
Some of me frunds calls me Mr Botaniste."  
I'd try it on any ground.  
"Quite useless," returned Tolly.  
Tom submitted patiently.  
"A devil with two faces!"  
and let his lower jaw drop.  
demanded the  
Indian.  
"It is false," returned the chief.  
"Now, Redskin--" began Bevan.  
"Well, I don't think he'll do it."  
What would you call that, Tolly?"  
He will never forsake me."  
"Yes; try to take a little.  
Why, Tolly,  
boy, it is--yes!  
Isn't Miss--"  

The Irishman paused.  
See, there's another flock  
comin'.  
How he did run, to be sure!  
"But where was he a-runnin' to, an' why?"  
"`D'ye know any of these birds?'  
says I; `I should think I does!  
"But I haven't got a father."  
"Why, 'cause it wouldn't" replied Drake.  
He  
was fond o' showin' off, you know!  
However, it  
matters not.  
It matters nothin' to me.  
"But what does your father think.  
Read me this trail if ye can."  
Can you read anything more?"  
us three attack fifty men?"  
I think the bone has escaped."  
"What says Mahoghany Drake on the subject!"  
Volunteers were not wanting.  
Did you try to quiet him?"  
"Did you know his mother, then?"  
At last she looked up quickly.  
"Why, what do you mean, father?  
But that's all bam, Betty.  
`Why, she's in  
hospital.  
What's the name of the school?  
But I was ready for him.  
Shall I tell mother that you're comin'?'  
But never fear, I'll join you.  
said Tom, with a perplexed look.

PREPARING FOR AN ATTACK                 207     XXVII.  
Those Indians were starving!  
He was hungry and vicious.  
His brilliant eyes served him well.  
Boy kill him when he stood up."  
"No he can't, nor you either.  
"How'd you get it, anyway?"  
Git up; it's time to travel."  
"Not starve to death any more."  
"All other trail go this way.  
"Will they attack us, father?"  
are you so thirsty as that?  
Keep your courage up, my boy."  
Not a greenhorn or a tenderfoot among 'em.  
I don't know 'bout the old mare.  
Don't you go off the handle."  
"I mustn't say too much to him.  
"Oh father, give me some more."  
Go steal pony pretty soon."  
"Don't go too far, that's all."  
"It'll all be over with me.  
Let him come one length nearer."  
"We'd better take a rest here, jedge.  
It all plainly meant,  "Come on.  
Dog go right on," said Long Bear.  
Here are little books like this."  
None of them are cut or trimmed."  
"No smoke anywhere," said Pine.  
"I've got him," said Yellow Pine.  
"No whoopin' sounded," said Yellow Pine.  
"I'd call it---- Jedge, it's jest so.  
He can talk some English, too.  
He needn't play 'possum any longer."  
See that he doesn't get away."  
Great warrior by-and-by, like father.  
almost breathlessly exclaimed Na-tee-kah.  
Had he killed anybody?  
to Long Bear and his best men.  
Don't go too fast nor too far.  
Everything's goin' prime now."  
Ask Two Arrows when he come."  
One seemed to move a little.  
asked the judge, as they rode in.  
Then came Sile's experiment.  
Show you about that to-morrow morning."  
"That's fun," said Yellow Pine.  
He won't carry back no news.  
The new time is coming, Pine."  
"Guess that's what it is, then."  
Use bait, and pull 'em right in.  
You won't have to skitter it a bit."  
"No, he won't break any line.  
These 'ere Nez Percs ain't a bad lot.  
Long Bear came among the rest.  
He brought me fair specimens.  
"If they ain't struck with the mine-fever now.  
"All right, boys," he responded.  
asked Pine, a little proudly.  
"Make shingles to cover house."  
Great chief in a little while.  
I mean to go right along.  
"There they are; six of 'em," said Sile.  
"No see us," said Two Arrows.  
Get there before Apache.  
"I must have killed him outright!"  
I wish he had a rifle."  
"There will be storms," said the judge.  
But now just look at that wall."  
I hope he hasn't been wiped out.  
"Two Arrows is right," said Pine.  
Too much heap shoot; kill 'em all."  
"What are you doing up there?"  
Got Nez Perc eye now; want pale-face eye."

All signs of the storm had passed.  
"At any rate, we will try.  
"Do you not remember me?  
"You can come out without fear."  
I have seen many changes.  
It was a glorious view.  
"Why do they not shoot the dogs?"

These were termed adventurers.  
We will soon have a fire."  
All was, however, quiet.  
"No, I think they are great birds.  
"But first of all, for a drink.  
"Shall we light a fire, Ned?  
All animals fear fire."  
"Now, Tom, do you climb the tree.  
I wonder what they can be!"  
"Let us receive them as friends."  
Now, let us reassure them."  
"It must be the Indian."  
The natives were delighted.  
So at least they are described.  
"What can they be waiting for?"  
Not a native was in sight.  
"He seems paralyzed," Ned said.  
There, drink a little water."

"I know not the place," Ned said.  
"I have heard of no such tribe.  
"No boat could live in that sea."  
"Would you advise us to fly?"  
I can give you no advice.  
Tom assented gravely to the address.  
What have you to say to this?"  
The walls were damp with moisture.  
"I have not the keys," he said.  
A desperate struggle ensued.  
"What on earth are they doing?"  
"Do you not recognize me?

The prospect seemed dark, indeed.

This programme was carried out.

Nick was hardly less disturbed.

"On deck, sir," replied the mate.

No one could tell what he meant.

"How came you up there, captain?"  
"What will it do then, Captain Alick?"  
"His son Nick has disappeared."

"You quite mistake my meaning.  
"But you did not pay it in."  
"I must be candid with you, Cornwood.  
It looked like an inland sea.

This, with the swabs, made clean work.

"You are so kin-d to ask," she said.  
"Oh, let us have a hansom!  
Books are very deceptive."  
I am going to do it."  
"Don't you see that they all do?  
"I wonder what that can be?"  
Her contentment knew no bounds.  
"It is a surprise indeed.  
Amy,--why where is Amy?"  
He can't afford it, I know."  
"Why, we are staying here too."  
Some Western friend, I suppose."  
I am so glad I brought you!  
"Oh, how perfectly charming!  
"Yes, I heard of her marriage.  
Europe to her was all "things."  
You needn't be afraid, Lilly."  
"What sort of thing do you mean?"  
"Good afternoon," said a voice.  
She says it is growing cool."  
cried the delighted children.  
ON THE TRACK OF ULYSSES.  
"Polyphemus was a horrible giant.  
"Does the tower really lean?"  
"We shall know to-morrow," replied Katy.  
Even mendicant friars are human.  
Amy was insatiable.  
You won't mind, will you, Katy?"  
A tame fawn was tethered there.  
Katy made haste with the note.  
Katy augured ill from this reserve.  
It hurts the back of my neck.  
asked Katy, in amazement.  
What you ask might kill the child.  
It was her brother, at last.  
I shall always regret it."  
"She is a trump of a girl.  
"Have the Pages left Nice yet?"  
There was the dawn just tingeing the east.  
How silly I was to cry!  
"Ned, you are the dearest boy!  
with a shrug of her shoulders.  
What shall I do without you?"  
Can you ever forgive me?"  
She was fairly crying now.  
I hope I wasn't cross to her!  
She's just stupid, poor child!

The country was eaten up.  
"Leave that matter in my hands.  
"Will you want a light sword and battle-axe?"  
"I will," he said, "tell the men-at-arms off to-night.  
"Thanks, thanks, my good Cnut," Cuthbert cried.  
Then the smooth voice spoke again.  
"What means this outrage, young sir?  
exclaimed the earl, cordially.  
"No, no, sire," said the earl.  
However, we shall soon see.  
the royal standard is down."  
"You are but a boy," he said.  
"On what ground did this happen?"  
By whom it was done none knew.  
"It shall be so," the king said.  
You shall accompany me.  
By daylight the road is good.  
"I like not this country," Cnut said.  
"Wolves are no bigger than dogs.  
We should make short work of them."  
It grew louder and louder.  
Cnut exclaimed in an awestruck voice.  
To whom do I owe my life?"  
It was a large flagged courtyard.  
The baron frowned heavily.  
"We have prepared for that," Cnut said.  
Of the rest you are aware.  
"Thanks, good fellow," Cuthbert said.  
"I know no more than yourself.

It was a grand assembly.

the old gentleman grunted.  
"There is not much to see, sir.  
"I don't know, sir," Charlie said.  
"I don't know, sir," Charlie said.  
"How can he say such a thing?"  
"He doesn't mean it," Charlie laughed.  
"No," Mr. Tufton said, thoughtfully.  
"And now," he said, "ring the bell.  
"What do they quarrel about?"  
"It will be getting dark, then.  
Have you had any practice?"  
What is in the other case?  
Charlie exclaimed in surprise.  
Behind this a steep hill rose.  
The captain shouted "Fire!"  
The effect was decisive.  
The Indiaman was still in confusion.  
Meat here is fearfully coarse and tasteless.  
"Will you have some bananas?"  
In three days he had a breach.  
Chunda Sahib remained, as the guest of Dupleix, at Pondicherry.  
Muzaffar charged them with his cavalry.  
Captain Cope is no better.  
Great delay was caused by this.  
"Which do you hope they will be?"  
Doctor," he said, "how are you?  
"We hate it, sir," Charlie said.  
"Most warmly," the doctor said.  
"I am," Clive said quietly.  
Doctor Rae said, astonished.  
I shall see you tomorrow.  
They're just cruel to look at.  
said Corporal Jones to me.  
"'Put your foot on it, man,' says he.  
Tim said, in admiration.  
The effect was tremendous.  
"Oh, they larn fast enough," said Tim.  
"Shure and I saw him," Tim said.  
"Oh no, I don't want him, Tim.  
Neither party liked to charge.  
At this moment, Clive returned.  
Three hundred French Sepoys had fallen.  
Here they were again challenged.  
The English loss was heavy.  
Chunda Sahib, in vain, begged him to do so.  
"And you have to keep from quarrelling, Tim.  
I will go across to the rajah."  
Each evening they shall be weighed."  
"Let him be executed."  
I swear it by the Prophet."  
Charlie was insensible.  
Should I not give mine for him?  
"Is there any hope for him?"  
The effect was decisive.  
A council of war was held.  
"What on earth is the matter?"  
Here he established a piratical fleet.  
"It does, Tim; but the curs can bite.  
If they haven't set her afire!"  
"She is doomed," Charlie exclaimed.  
The wildest confusion raged.  
"He is dead, Sahib," Hossein replied.  
"Yes, Captain Marryat, she has done well.  
"When shall we be at Madras?"  
Did you ever see the like?"  
We dine in half an hour."  
He looked fagged and dispirited.  
He can decide on nothing.  
"Have you seen them safely off?"  
But you are my right hand here.  
"Let us remain where we are.  
Charlie then turned to the girl.  
"How are you feeling, Ada?"  
That will be pleasant, won't it?"  
Hour passed after hour.  
"She has fainted, Tim," he said.  
They are faint from the struggles.  
Make a charge to the window.  
The master's alive yet."  
Chapter 19: A Daring Escape.  
If not, throw the arrow down.  
Again the sentry challenged.  
Then there was a long silence.  
"Is it climb up, yer honor?  
You saved my life that night at Ambur.  
I hired a little house.  
I was dressed as a trader.  
Once with us, you will be safe."  
"I am only a servant.  
The woman hesitated.  
"It is dangerous," she said.  
"Not at all," Hossein replied.  
In front stood a great courtyard.  
"Lean out, and I will take you."  
We have got things here for you."  
"You are lucky, old fellow.  
"And this is Tim," Charlie said.  
We'll soon rig you out again."  
He calls himself my servant.  
and then gave three rousing cheers.  
The nabob took it all in.  
Charlie willingly agreed.  
Terms were speedily arranged.  
"Yes, half an hour ago."  
All took a share in the toil.  
You remember that night at Moorshedabad."  
"Yes," Major Eyre Coote replied.  
The effect was decisive.  
The enemy fought bravely.  
The British loss was trifling.  
Chapter 24: Mounted Infantry.  
That is out of the question.  
The effect was tremendous.  
The toil was very severe.  
Chapter 26: The Siege Of Madras.  
The French guns opened fire.  
"What do you mean by a shindy, Tim?"  
Not a thraneen have they touched for months.  
"That is so," Colonel Forde said.  
"You are right, and I am wrong.  
He determined to attack.  
Peters had been twice wounded.  
"Have you heard from home lately?"  
"I intend to do so, Tim.  
The combat was a short one.  
Most of the other ships were dismasted.  
What on earth am I doing?  
his mother said, anxiously.

Corny went out to find him.  
asked Corny, in a low tone.  
"You astonish me, captain!"  
"Get over the fence, Corny.  
"All this is absurd, Mulgate," interposed Captain Carboneer.  
"Very well; that is enough.  
"Where is this long gun, my man?"  
It is all right as it is."  
Perhaps he is with father."  
Then he had a chance to think.  
What are you talking about?"  
"Then I have lost my senses.  
"I see now," added Christy.  
"You mistook Corny for me."  
"Have they come again so soon?"  
"You are going to hail her!"  
"I have no time to spare now."  
Bring a lantern out of the engine-room!"  
"Don't bring a lantern in sight!"  
"What's the row there, Sampson?"  
"Of course it is," replied the middy.  
"Have you plenty of steam on?"  
"All right, Paul," added Christy.  
Of course, that disabled her.  
suggested the midshipman.  
You buoyed it, did you not?"  
"Stand by to repel boarders!"  
"Perhaps you want him, Florry?"  
asked Christy of his sister.  
Major Pierson, who is he?"  
"I am so sorry for him.  
"I shall do nothing with him.  
he inquired, with a smile.  
"I do; and I have seen him.  
exclaimed the sheet-anchor man, suddenly.  
"What could have disabled her?"  
"Who are those two men forward?"  
The surgeon was close by him.  
asked the captain, with a smile.  
"Select your own boat and crew.  
"No lie in that," chuckled Flint.  
"All right," said the lieutenant.  
"That means to run the blockade?"  
"Where did this steamer come from?"  
asked Christy curiously.  
"Which side do you belong on?"  
"What is this boat here for, Dave?"  
"Let the leadsmen sound, Beeks," said Christy.  
Christy rang to slow her down.  
demanded the shore speaker.  
continued the man on shore.  
"Where was she fitted out, Dave?"  
"Buoy on the starboard, sir!"  
reported the leadsman on that side.  
She is a privateer," replied Christy.  
"We had no fight at all, sir.  
Have you any prisoners?"  
"That is the idea, sir.  
"What do you propose to do?  
shouted some one on the shore.  
"The Teaser," replied Christy.  
"All right," repeated Christy.  
"I am waiting for Gilder!  
"Is that you, Captain Gilder?"  
"Good for you, Captain Gilder!"  
"You are a prisoner now."  
asked Christy, with interest.  
asked Flint, rather timidly.  
"What are you waiting for, Flint?"  
"Where are the rest of the men?"  
"Here are the ship's papers.  
Come on board at six o'clock."

"What do you say to it, Jim Walsham?"  
"Not she," the fisherman said.  
Mrs. Walsham said, greatly surprised.  
I should like it very much.  
"But what do you think, my boy?  
"So that is settled, ma'm.  
"Oh, nonsense, little woman!  
What is there to object to?  
Besides, I must live, you know."  
"Yes, Aggie, very sorry.  
The squire never interfered.  
have you had enough of it?"  
"I thought you weren't any good.  
I hurt him a good deal more.  
The squire listened silently.  
"I says to Simon, 'What a shame!'  
"I have heard quite sufficient.  
"Take Aggie for a walk, James.  
The sergeant hesitated.  
Your son saved Aggie's life.  
Mrs. Walsham broke in with a laugh.  
But it will be a wrench, ma'am.  
"Nothing to say to her, ma'am!  
The squire was hard for a bit.  
Can she come up this evening?"  
"You must not cry any more.  
I gave up hope years ago.  
How did it come about, John?"  
the child said, taking his hand pleadingly.  
But you won't say that, will you?  
"Why, you have got a fire!"  
I waited on them, myself.  
"Things had gone badly with me.  
"I hoped you would not take her.  
Still, all this is no excuse.  
"Of course, I was mistaken.  
"We must be friends, sir, great friends.  
Now, what is your idea?  
"And he really saved her life?"  
"He did," the sergeant replied.  
she exclaimed, clapping her hands.  
the latter asked him one day.  
The squire burst into a good-humoured laugh.  
We shall see when he comes home."  
"Are you really in earnest, grampa?"  
"Well, I haven't neglected him, grampa.  
"So be it, then," the squire said.  
Everything portended a severe gale.  
It is blowing dead on shore.  
I don't like the lad myself.  
How could you think such a thing!  
Of course, the whole thing was changed.  
James was now helped to his feet.  
"Oh, James, how could you do it?"  
"They have dragged up three of them.  
Whatever will the squire say?"  
"A grand fellow, Wilks, isn't he?"  
The child will be blown away."  
The skipper uttered an oath.  
If not, they will have us yet."  
He therefore now stepped forward.  
"A fine morning, lieutenant."  
"There will be wind presently.  
"Then the smuggler got away?"  
The fisherman was silent.  
"Things have gone very wrong, squire."  
"A malicious young viper!  
The scene was a busy one.  
These men can fight their own way.  
Chapter 10: The Fight At Lake George.  
No one returned to his work.  
"There is no time to be lost.  
The musketry fire was unbroken.  
Here each man fights for himself.  
"In that case, it is settled.  
Jonathan was behind him.  
"That is so," the scout replied.  
James Walsham asked Nat, in a low tone.  
It's a case of legs, now.  
Colonel Otway received James with great cordiality.  
I heard you were with Johnson."  
"That is my own opinion, Walsham.  
You would train your men as scouts.  
What do you think of my plan?"  
"I thought so," the colonel said.  
"So be it," the colonel said.  
You see them at their worst here.  
Nat said contemptuously.  
"He won't mind, I hope," James said.  
They are improving with their muskets.  
It may be some three miles down.  
"'That's one for you, Jim,' says I.  
"It ain't likely," Nat replied.  
"They have set fire to the sloops."  
These were still unconverted.  
"That is just what I thought, Nat.  
When do you think of starting?"  
"The sooner the better, Nat."  
"How far is Crown Point away?"  
"Not more than ten miles," Nat said.  
"Thank God you are back again!  
"What's the matter then, Nat?"  
"What do you think, Jonathan?"  
"Where are my brothers going?"  
"Not a bit of it, captain.  
"Now your paddles," Nat exclaimed.  
Chapter 15: Through Many Perils.  
"Why shouldn't we lie down here, Nat?"  
James at once changed the order.  
The canoes were checked at once.  
Nothing done, nothing ready.  
Why, I have nothing to do.  
"We shall go very slowly.  
The whole army then landed.  
Both armies were suffering.  
"No," the general replied.  
"There are no thanks due to me.  
Now, have you thought out a plan?"  
When will the attempt be made?"  
What a mistake he had made!  
An officer stepped forward.  
"The boat was struck twice, you say?"  
"We must keep a sharp lookout.  
"Look here," the midshipman said.  
Chapter 20: The Path Down The Heights.  
"Not quite so bad," James replied.  
He fell some five or six feet.  
he said, as he approached him.  
But perhaps you are hungry."  
the general asked quickly.  
The admiral rang the bell.  
"Captain Walsham is my enemy.  
They went at them with a rush.  
"It is all over with me."  
All that is past and over.  
That settles the whole matter."  
"I sha'n't give you the chance, Aggie.  
You can rely upon that."
